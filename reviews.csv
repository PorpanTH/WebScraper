5.0,"Thank you to all the staff at Chongfah for creating such a memorable 50th bday for my husband Mr Peter in July. We were a party of 10 adults & two children. The staff ensured we had everything we needed and even put on a special 50th bday breakfast. The room were exceptionally clean & cleaned to a high standard daily. We looked forward to seeing the towel art each day.Beds, very comfy with a choice of pillows from the pillow menu.Lots of variety for breakfast with a buffet & ordering from a menu, great coffee best I e had in Thailand all while looking out over the ocean. Happy hour each night by the pool with a good choice of cocktails.The staff are Chongfah's biggest asset.Thank you"
5.0,"Checking in was really a breeze, a warm welcome from Sukanya and the ladies was genuinely friendly and made us feel right at home.The infinity Pool is great for a dip and laps in the early morning or late afternoon.Our air conditioned room is spacious and very comfortable, clean no stale smoke smells excellent! The bathroom is a contemporary design with a nice shower. The bed is very very comfortable. The Wifi is good. The Large  T.V screen has a good reception.Breakfast is excellent with fruit, yoghurt, and musli you can order a cooked breakfast from the menue also. The coffee is the best we have ever had from a hotel. There are lots of restaurants close by, but we dined here most of the time as the food is excellent. The hotel is situated close to a nice beach with soft sand( only accessible at low tide). Khao Lak is an ok town, the local villagers are a mix of retirees and farmers it's really laid back here. Hire a motor bikefor 150 Bht a day, from bike shop around the corner.My wife and I love this place so we will be back.Hope this helps; enjoy."
5.0,"This place is so good. From the moment we checked in, the staff were very friendly and did the utmost to fulfil every request we had. They are all very friendly, we will miss chatting to Yada and Rodger at the bar. We had a Sea View Bungalow and it was fantastic. Very spacious and clean, had a large whirlpool spa and inside + outside showers, and a large bed. My only concern here was that the bed was very wide but my feet hung off the edge (I'm 6ft tall) if I wasn't up quite high. The restaurant has nice food and plenty of choices, both western and Thai, although we found the prices to be slightly better outside the resort. Drinks at the bar were quite expensive, especially cocktails (~250 baht!), which you can definitely get cheaper if you wander outside the resort. They offer bikes that you can use which is more than enough to get around considering the great location the resort is in. We hired a scooter and found it was nice, but you definitely would get away with just the bikes. Could not recommend this place more, definitely stay here if you're looking at hotels around the area."
5.0,"Can't say enough positive things the resort is a small boutique 30 somthing  rooms...Great pool with wet edge... breakfast included order off menu what ever you like and how much you want. Nice  selection off  buffet as well, coffee, cupachino better than  most coffee shop chains... would highly recommend... if you want to relax... perfect for couples...The team at chongfa could not do enough.. to make our stay more delightful...."
5.0,"This hotel is situated on the sea front although the beach is very small but there are beaches within a 5 minute walk. The swimming pool is bigger than it looks with a magnificent view out to see, you have the impression you are swimming out to see. The staff are very friendly and helpful and can't do enough to help you. The food in the restaurant is good and reasonably priced. There are bikes available for free to use. There is a market four days a week just a 5 minute walk away and many bars restaurants and shops just up the road from the hotel. We have loved our stay here and would recommend it."
5.0,We stayed for 10 days in a sea view bungalow - great room and a massive bed with pillow menu!Pool is great and bigger than it looks in the photos.The staff are excellent and very friendly Would recommendWe went on trips to James Bond Island (do the Early Bird trip to avoid crowds) and also went to Phi Phi Islands despite it being low season. Also went to Turtle Sanctuary and bathing with Elephants. More than we expected would be possible in low season
5.0,"We came here during rainy season but still enjoyed the stay.. from start to finish nothing was too much for the staff! I read some reviews and I'm baffled by the comments, I think a lot comes down to how you treat the staff, treat them with kindness and respect and that's exactly what you get back. The staff all knew our names, and being one of the younger couples staying at the resort I have to stay it was so lovely and peaceful! Breakfast was excellent lots to choose from and I especially liked all the fresh juices to choose from, fruit and yogurts! The view is beautiful and the pool was lovely and warm. The room is kitted out with everything you need, the back of the room looks like a dressing room with a good size dressing table and wardrobe. Mosquito plugs and candles in the room, umbrellas for when it rained and great sized balcony. We really like the fact that you could use the bikes free of charge too. Great location lots of restaurants and bars with a few minutes walk! Overall brilliant stay keep up the good work! My sister and her boyfriend stayed at a hotel across the road a week later and came for the marvellous pad Thai and yummy ice cream milkshakes on our recommendation!"
5.0,"We loved everything about our stay here. We had a beach front bungalow as we were on our honeymoon and it was so luxurious waking up to the looking at the waves every morning. The cocktails were great, pool was awesome and they had free bikes you could use which was fun. The beach is washed away however we much prefer swimming in pools so this wasn't an issue for us. We did their cooking class too which was great. All staff were very friendly and spoke great English. We definitely felt at home and it was a great place to relax. Thankyou so much chongfah. We will be back again one day."
2.0,"I don't understand good reviews of this place.Deluxe room: dark, noisy air conditioner with mosquitoes in the room. We had some problems in the room and after complaining  several times, because they ignore at begining,Pancake  became rude and ironic to us.No security. Anyone can enter to the hotel. As you lay down on the sunbed, you see people walking by, and staring you.Breakfast: average and no fresh juice. Some unfriendly staff."
4.0,"I had delayed in posting this review because while this resort has its merits and commendable customer service, we continue to be at a lost at its #1 ranking on this site. Our stay was in early May. Perhaps if it was subcategorized under ""good value"" and a ""boutique-y"" vibe, then a high rating is justifiable for the Chongfah Resort (CR). But #1 for ALL of Khao Lak? We respectfully disagree. Laid-back, definitely. Luxury (as described by another reviewer)? Ur, no. To quantify our assessment, some background..... We came to Khao Lak at the beginning of the slow season and started the first half staying at what would turn out to be our best beach-front, luxury splurge resort experience ever. We had planned for switching out to a smaller, boutique-y resort for the second half and chose CR based on the raving TA reviews. Suffice to say we had so thoroughly enjoyed the first resort that any other Khao Lak resorts will pail in comparison. And in hindsight, we would've liked to have remained at our first choice the entire duration. But I don't mean to digress.....At Chongfah, based on some passing observations, I am guessing that there's possibly some planned expansion forthcoming. And some rooms were in the process of refurbishment during our stay. But for now, CR is simply a compact, bare basic sea-side compound. CR is esthetically pleasing, but nothing that stands out to explain its high ranking. The pool area overlooks into the sea and there's plenty of loungers, and even a couple of pagoda-like cabanas. Because of it being the slow season, CR told us they were at 50% occupancy, but we really never saw more than two other couples at once. Seriously, if you're a mega celebrity and looking to hide from the paparazzi, this is the place!We had a generous room that abutted a roadway but faced into the dense, resort garden. We encountered some rain during our stay, which made the covered balcony patio, and it's accompanying loungers the perfect vegging and reading spot. I'll do a separate review for their restaurant, the Seaborn. But the breakfast buffet needs some commenting. Specific staff in the dinning room must be new as they where tentative and shy. They didn't know or weren't sure of even the most basic questions. This resort is somewhat tucked away, that it will take around 12-15 minutes' walk up to the main road. Along the way are plenty of shops for inexpensive massages, tailor, dinning and bars. Resort staff were friendly and accommodating."
5.0,"This place is simply amazing. This is our second trip to the resort and I’m glad to say it’s every bit as charming as the first time we stayed. The staff are lovely and that’s everyone including the cleaners whose attention to detail is second to none. The rooms are spacious and the beds are so comfy. The food is delicious and a good price. The breakfast has a good choice , there is something for everyone !  I would recommend the omelettes which are made fresh to order. The resort pool is a big highlight. It’s never too crowded and the view of the sea when you are swimming is great. This is a lovely resort with amazing staff who make you feel like nothing is too much trouble. I would thoroughly recommend this resort if you are looking to relax and chill out. We will be back next year !"

4.0,We stayed here 5 years ago and loved it so decided  to stay again but after covid it starting to look a little sad the rooms are really good and comfy thai style we had upstairs  balcony with sun lounges great looking out at the ocean over pool the best part of the resort. They offer lots of little extras other places don't. Breakfast was ok but because  not a lot of guests  I think too much waste with buffet  style.  Staff  great easy to walk on the beach and heaps food nearby. would I stay again maybe not but it has a really nice feel and loved my 5 days .
5.0,The hotel is on the beach. The pool overlooks the ocean. Beautiful sunsets. Great breakfast. Rooms are nice. BUT the best thing is the staff-- they all care about the guest all the time. This is extremely rare at the price point.
5.0,After visiting the last time in January 2020 we returned for 10 days over Christmas and New Year. This small boutique hotel is still as excellent as ever. Their location is beautiful and in an lovely spot for beach and other amenities including bars and restaurants. However the hotel can only be rated five-star thanks to all of the brilliant staff they have working here. A special shout out to Kate and the reception team for their support with travel and other plans needed due to Covid. Also a really good restaurant and bar team and the housekeeping support is also first class.
4.0,"Hot on the heels of the review below, I can agree that this beautiful hotel is not for people with young children. We have just returned from Khao Lak, which we loved, but ended up moving to a more family friendly resort with our one year old, after three nights at Chong Fah... The hotel is in a fab location, easy walk to local bars/ restaurants of Bang Niang. Beach location however isn't brilliant. Tides mean it's a narrow beach at best, if non existent. The hotel is a lovely size, not of big or too small. Great restaurant, for both breakfast and dinner. Loved it all. This would have been the perfect place for us pre-baby.The clientele here during our stay were mostly older, quiet couples, clearly here to relax and read quietly around the very beautiful pool. We felt bad every time our baby cried (or giggled!), and soon became quite uncomfortable, feeling like we were spoiling the peace! Anyway, we left with no fuss, with part of our stay kindly refunded. The management were very helpful and understanding in this, but I agree with the poster below, perhaps it's time for the management to introduce a no-child policy. There's nothing here for kids anyway, and I suspect older kids (16 and under) would be bored out of their brains! However, to list the many positives:Room was stunning, with better views than expected over the pool to the sea (we booked a standard room). It was huge, and beautifully furnished in Thai/Balinese style. In fact, I wondered whether we had been upgraded (we hadn't), so the deluxe rooms must be amazing... Spotless, comfy bed, plenty of storage and mod cons. Bathroom was lovely. All very romantic too!Staff were very lovely, very helpful, if quieter and more discrete than we came across during our trip to Thailand. But I think that goes hand in hand with the atmosphere at Chong Fah.Food/drinks, superb, and not much more expensive than other local restaurants. All in all, this place is a gem. Just don't go with a young family. If I ever get the chance to return to Chong Fah with just my husband, well, that would be heaven..."
5.0,"There are so many good things to write about Chong Fah Resort that it could take up the whole review, but I thought I’d try to write a beneficial review that may be helpful to others thinking about staying here. I am being brutally honest here – so the People at Chong Fah should regard it as constructive criticism. I will try to address the issues raised by previous reviewers and cast my unbiased comment on their views.1.	Some reviewers commented about the large number of Germans staying at Chong Fah – yes there is a lot of Germans, but they were friendly, and like us, looking for a good holiday regardless of who else stays there. Spare a thought for the staff - having to speak English and German, plus Russian and whatever else.2.	Not many children stayed there – so from my perspective that is a real plus. No unnecessary splashing in the pool, and an absence of incessant squealing and crying. Sorry if I offend some parents – I have raised 4 children of my own and enjoy the peace and quiet now they have grown up. You will feel the same one day.3.	Most people there were of the age 45 – 65, so being in the 50 – 60 age group, I felt quite at home.4.	There is no beautiful white sand beach in front of Chong Fah – the beach has been reclaimed and there is a rock wall with stairs leading to the beach. The beach is only visible at low tide – so if you love the beach for sun baking and swimming – find somewhere else to stay, or take a short walk to where the sandy beach in its natural state is available..5.	The room facilities:a.	Power points are not in abundance, so charging phones and tablets is a little challenging using all available power outlets. My suggestion is to take a light weight power board – in fact that is a great tip for whenever you go overseas.b.	There is no PC work area/ desk – I had to use the coffee area and a stool, which gave me a sore back. The room is not suitable if you want to conduct some business whilst there.c.	The chairs (inside and outside) are not very comfortable, in fact other than the bed, most furniture is there for looks rather than comfort.6.	The restaurant is very good and very affordable compared to many resorts. Yes it is cheaper outside, at restaurants with lower overheads, but for an extra 40% or so you get great service and the convenience of not having to leave the resort. This is a resort you can move into and stay for your whole holiday without feeling as if your missing out on something. This is not my style but it may suit some. 7.	Being a small “boutique” resort has many benefits. From the front entrance to the further most room is only a short stroll. This means the pool and the restaurant are very conveniently located, not far from any rooms.8.	The resort is fairly friendly to people with disabilities – reasonably flat with ramps available 9.	Water pressure for the indoor shower was poor in our room – but we were at the end of the row of units and often that means you get the worst water pressure. The outdoor shower was great, but it wasn’t hot. We didn’t use the outdoor spa, but some people may find that more attractive than we did10.	Coffee machine was great – very good for an in-room facility.11. Khao Lak is like Phuket was 20 - 30 years ago. That was attractive to us but may be a problem to those looking to be in the centre of activity. Dining prices are cheaper and there is more top quality restaurants and bars."
5.0,"During our 6th visit, Chong Fah Resort continued to offer its special magic. In Thailand it is common to experience happy and friendly staff at hotels, but here with the boutique nature of the resort and the superb leadership from the owners and Khun Rong, the service is at an even higher level. The teamwork is so evident, as is the desire of all employees to make their guests’ time at Chong Fah as memorable as possible.The restaurant offers a good choice at breakfast, and the dinner menu is excellent. The Asian Buffet is an absolute MUST! Despite the high quality of the food (and naturally the chefs), the prices are very reasonable. Certainly, one could eat for less money in local restaurants, but without the same guarantee of quality and cleanliness.Housekeeping do a wonderful job. Our room was always cleaned to perfection, and they bring special touches to their work, especially with a range of creative towel “sculptures”.  But sadly this year we have also experienced one problem, which made the holiday less enjoyable. Chong Fah is a resort to relax at. Many reviews note that it is not suitable for children. How right that is. But this time a family of three - the parents and their young child - did their best to destroy the peaceful ambience. Although during the previous visits, we also noticed children, but they behaved well and there was no reason for complaints. This child, a boy about three or four years old, was allowed to run around screaming in the restaurant at mealtimes and behaved the same way in the pool. He was simply not controlled by the parents. Which may not be a surprise because the mother was also extremely loud. They also ate at the poolside, with the inevitable result that, for example, ice-cream ended up in the pool. This poor behaviour affected almost all the other guests, and was a recurring topic of discussion. We coped in part by changing our daily rhythm - for example only going to breakfast after the child had left and the clean-up process had begun and timing our swims in the pool to avoid him.We wonder if it might not be time for the Resort to turn to a formal “no-children” policy - the resort is simply not big enough and does not have the facilities for children, especially young ones. Many boutique hotels are now taking this route. It is not to do with not liking children, solely that some resorts are not suitable for them."
5.0,"Nb. this resort is located in Phang Nga and not Takua Pa!!I have never experienced anything like my time at the Chong Fah, from where I have just returned after two weeks for my honeymoon. It was the holiday of a lifetime, exceeding all my (very high) expectations, and the Chong Fah was central to that, From the moment we arrived we felt at home, and were made to feel like the most important guests at the resort, and am sure all the other guests were made to feel exactly the same. Beautiful location, perfect resort design, incredible cleanliness, service that goes way beyond the call of duty (I would not single out any individual staff members, everyone from the management to the groundsmen were wonderful), food to make your mouth water.... it has it all. I could go on and on, but would not begin to express how much I miss the place. If you are considering Khao Lak, and considering the Chong Fah, I guarantee you will never make a better decision then to go for it. Am sure I will return one day, and I cannot wait!"
5.0,"Now I am sure there are many wonderful hotels throughout the world which could rival the Chongfah Beach Resort. I have stayed in many of them. But this was like Paradise to me.It is,  quite a small hotel with only about 30 rooms. Some are beach bungalows, some garden bungalows and some Garden view rooms. My daughter and I chose a beach bungalow, which, for us, was absolutely right. We had a huge bedroom a beautiful bathroom and a seperate spa/jacuzzi bath.Seperated from the rolling waves by a low wall, and a strip of grass they are as close to the sea as you can get without getting your feet wet. The infinity pool felt like swimming in warm velvet. Surrounded by well tended gardens and trees decked with twinkling lights there is an exclusive, peaceful feel to the whole resort. We chose to eat most evenings in the hotel restaurant which again faces out across the sea. They had barbeques and buffets most evenings which, we found were quite reasonably priced. Happy hour offered two cocktails for the price of one.  We watched the fishing boats as they set sail and enjoyed cocktails sat on comfortable sofas and chairs situated on the grass next to the ocean. Everything is clean and well cared for from the toilets to the well tended gardens. You can take the free bikes in the foyer and cycle down the quiet road outside the hotel to a beach about a half mile away. The beach next to the hotel is very small, though the guests go swimming from there. The waves are quite strong and you could hurt yourselve on the rocks. The hotel offer spa treatments and massage although we had no time to take advantage of them.The staff are friendly and efficient. The breakfast offers everything from omelettes to curry. If I had one small criticism I would say they need to keep all the breakfast foods covered as the cold meats and salads were left unprotected allowing small flies to get on the food. We tended to choose the freshly cooked eggs or omelettes and bacon and toast as all these were kept under cover. You are within easy walking distance of all the shops restaurants and bars where cocktails are offered at about 99bhts (£2), although the amount of alcohol they put in them can be quite mean compared to the ones at the Chongfah!   There is a market close by too. If you fancy Luis Vuitton or Gucci then this is the place for you. The prices might give you a clue to their pedigree though. We took a taxi to the Khao Lak waterfall which involves a half hour uphill walk to the falls. Another day we walked to the Tsunami memorial Park9still under construction) and saw the police boat which was washed up 2 klm inland. The marble memorial is especial touching. It represents the huge wave that engulfed this part of Thailand. We plan to return to Thailand and the Chong Fah is on our list of preferred hotels. After all, once you find Paradise you don't want to lose it!!"
2.0,"We booked this resort because of the good reviews of TripAdvisor, but it was a disappointment.-  Deluxe room:  a little bit old, too dark, and with a noisy air conditioner. There were mosquitoes in the room, and after complaining a couple of times, we finally asked them to put a mosquito net. They did it, but it looked that they did not like our request as they were quite rude and ironic to us. After this, the thai smiles were gone.- Breakfast: average and no fresh juice. Lack of hygiene with the bread. Employees did not use gloves. -  There is no security. Anyone can enter to the hotel. As you lay down on the sunbed, you see people walking by, and staring you.For the price you pay, there are better and friendlier choices in the area."

5.0,"The Chong Fah is a real gem of a small, boutique hotel, thoroughly deserving of its 5 star rating. The guest rooms are roomy and beautifully appointed, our beach front room was literally a few meters from the sea and included an outdoor whirlpool bath in addition to the indoor toilet and shower.The staff could not be more friendly and helpful, the domestic staff kept our room immaculately tidy despite our best efforts!The buffet breakfast was excellent and having eaten in for lunch or dinner on several days, we would thoroughly recommend the in house dining experience and food.Read more"
5.0,"This was our 5th visit to Chongfah and it’s standards have never dropped. It excels in all aspects, cleanliness, rooms, food and staff etc. It is a small resort with a wonderful family feel. You feel a person and not merely a room number.As this was our first trip since the outbreak of covid I admit to some trepidation, however it was groundless. Although Chongfah was sadly under occupied, we still had a good choice for breakfast, albeit table service. We usually had lunch at the resort and quite often dinner too as the food is so good and is comparable in price to the other restaurants in Bang Niang. We were so well looked after that we left totally relaxed with batteries recharged and looking forward to returning next year. Our grateful thanks to all the staff, especially the lovely ladies who cleaned our bungalow, Kate in reception and Roger, Bea and Cookie from the restaurant.See you next year our friends xRead more"

5.0,"This was my husband and my fourth visit to this fantastic resort. It is so good that we would now never go to any other hotel/resort in Khao Lak.It is a small resort with a relaxing, family atmosphere and where you are a person, not just a room number. We are lucky to have travelled extensively and the staff here are the friendliest and most efficient we have come across, and that is everyone from the restaurant and reception to the lovely lady who cleaned our bungalow.There is a nice selection of dishes for breakfast and should you wish to dine there for lunch or dinner, the food is very good and at a reasonable price.At low tide it’s possible to have a long walk along the beach. There is also a lovely infinity pool. The resort is in easy walking distance to Bang Niang town with all its amenities including a twice weekly market.We would like to pass on our thanks to all the staff particularly Yada in reception, Khean the lovely lady who cleaned our bungalow, Pea and May in the restaurant and special thanks to Roger and Sod in the restaurant, it was great to see you again this year.Read more"
4.0,"This is a lovely boutique hotel of approx 20 apartments. It has a wonderful infinity pool where you could just spend hours relaxing looking at the sea. The hotel is very much in to eco and therefore is very green in its approach. It is right on the beach and close to many shops and restaurants out side the resort but still nice and quiet. The staff are wonderful, helpful, friendly and very efficient which made the stay so much nicer. I would recommend this hotel and would return given the opportunity.Read more"
5.0,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  The staff are excellent.  Kate is a great manager and gave me good advice on a snorkeling trip.  Breakfast has a large number of choices.  A pretty infinity pool overlooks the sea.  Rooms are one floor of a two-story cottage-like structure and have a nice amount of room with a deck or outdoor area (but I'd have to say I never used it).  It's great to have breakfast outside right at seaside, or to use the lounge chairs that line the water front -- a great, peaceful place to relax.  Be aware, however, that there is no beachfront to the hotel (it's just rocks, so you can't access the water).  But you can walk north a block and there is a large beach area, or at the south end of the property there is a tiny little cove with some sand and you can go down to the water there.Read more"
5.0,"This is the second time war have been to the Chongfah and we had a wonderful time. The staff cannot do enough for you. It was relaxed and friendly. I celebrated my birthday there and they surprised with with a wonderfully decorated table, flowers from the gardens and even my own birthday cake and hand made card, it absolutely made my day. The quality and quantity of the food was brilliant and the cleanliness outstanding. Roger the manager was very accommodating and his and his staff are to be commended for giving us a memorable holiday. Thank you allRead more"
5.0,"Spent 4 nights at Chongfah this JanuaryLovely bed and breakfast, quietly tucked on the water, while near the townExtensive breakfast. nice and friendly staff. Roger at the restaurant is very helpful and kind. we ate nearly all of our meals here.Great pool, plenty of chairs by the pool or over the water.  There's a sea wall along the edge of the property, but you can walk down the water (note we experienced the little invisible 'stinging' jellies and didn't love the seawater anyway! much preferred the pool)We scheduled poolside massages which was relaxing and affordable at 350b/hr Halfway through our stay we asked to switch rooms - moving from the ground floor to an upstairs room was much better, and gave us a sunny terrace and better airflow. I'd recommend a top floor or water front.Recommend this hotel for a lovely b&b in Khao LakRead more"
5.0,Just a short review as we just wanted to thank all the staff for their excellent hospitality - they make this hotel a 5 star experience 👍. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation ! It’s a quiet location with access to beach down some steps / has a lovely warm pool and the food in the restaurant is excellent (stops you wanting to go out to nearby restaurants) - also prices for drinks very reasonable and they have a happy hour too !Read more
5.0,"My husband and I stayed at Chong Fah for 5 nights and had a very relaxing stay. The resort setting is beautiful with a large infinity pool looking out to the sea. There are 2 sun lounger areas - round the pool (non smoking) and on the other side of the pool (smoking area) looking out to sea.Our room was also very large, lovely big bed, pillow menu, large bathroom and large covered balcony with 2 sun loungers on - we liked sitting on these watching the view on the afternoons that it rained!Breakfast was good and the most extensive of our stay in Thailand. We ate lunch there most days as the offerings in town weren’t fantastic, as well as a couple of dinners - the food at Chong fah was the best Thai food that we found in Khao Lak and it wasn’t dumbed down for western tastes (which is what we experienced elsewhere in Khao Lak).The hotel also organised transfers for us to and from Phuket airport which was really smooth and comfortable. All in all if you want to relax and chill out with a beautiful view, lovely comfortable rooms and friendly staff, this is the place for you.Read more"
5.0,This is a really special hotel to stay at or visit for the day or as we did sunset and cocktails. You just have to use use the toilets to realise how immaculate this place is kept. The staff were so welcoming and the view is incredible. If you want a really peaceful hotel with garden rooms looking over the pool or hotel yet close to the village life then this is the best.Read more
5.0,"Everything positive that you read about this resort in other reviews is true so I won’t repeat it. What I want to share with you is my story which will give you an idea of how exceptional this place is.On my second night here I stumbled and fell. Sod (I believe it’s pronounced Sort) tried to save me ,he was terrified I was going to hit my head. In his attempt to save me he fell with me , I’m positive he must have hurt himself but did not show it.This was my own fault and was not the hotels fault in any shape or form.As I fell I severely broke my ankle, I ended up going to hospital in Phuket. I spent 3 nights in there and had 12 pins and a plate inserted. Sort came with us and helped to translate everything that was going on. He stayed with us until I told him to go home at about 4.30 am in the morning.We could not get hold of our insurance, Sod told me that the hotel had insurance and would happily use it for me all we had to do was pay the excess. I could have kissed him.The next day the owner came to the hospital to see how I was doing and bought me a beautiful flower arrangement and helped me feel confident that the bill was covered.The day after that she came again with a gift bag of biscuits.The food in the hospital was absolutely appalling, worse than the NHS and it was the same company sedexo that do our local hospital food. I asked my partner to ask the hotel if they could do me a sandwich or something. He came with a cheese and ham sandwich and other goodies and no charge. It sounds silly but it was the best sandwich I ever had.They paid for my Taxi to the hotel which was about £75.When I got back , there was a get well card and a message over the bed.The owner lent me a wheel chair and came to see me and ask if there was anything to help with my stay. I asked for some bags to cover my cast and a chair for the shower. When I returned to the room it was there and a table for my things.The hotel is not that easy to get around in a wheel chair but every time a member of the staff saw me they would come running over to help. It seems daft but they seemed to be fighting for the privelidge to help me. Even the chiefs would come running out to help.Nothing but nothing was to much bother, even phoning the room to check that we were all right. They carried me into the hotel, and I am a large lady, I know it hurt them.  4 people once carried me in the wheelchair.As people were helping me the waitress would be getting my table ready. They knew exactly what was working for me, ie they knew which table , they would move a chair out for my wheelchair and put a chair to rest my leg.They did so much for me that I was crying with emotion , they were so thoughtful and considerate. On the last day I was thanking Sod and he said that why would they not help me , this was my home! That summed it up for me , they want you to feel at home.They wear t shirts saying the Chong Fah team. Personally I think it should be changed to the Chong Fah family.I would like to say a massive thank you to everyone , from the owner to the reception staff but I’d like to say a special thank you to Sod, thank you for your time and the calming influence. Thank you for staying with me until 4.30 amRogerThank you for all that you did, for organising people and looking after Richard, for pushing me up a ramp.Yarda,Thank you for carrying me , putting your hands on my waist to steady me. Thank you for catching me when I wobbled.To all the waitresses, I’m sorry I don’t know your names, but thank you all for looking after me and carrying my crutches. Your attention to detail was lovely.This holiday was for my partner’s retirement . I was so upset that I felt it was ruined. Yes we didn’t do what we wanted but we made the most of it and without the love and care from all the staff it would have been totally ruined.We have decided that if we can we will be back in February. I have never gone to the same hotel twice but on this occasion I will be returning to the Chong Fah.Read more"
5.0,"We stayed here for two full weeks and had a great time. The place is clean and well-taken care of, it's not exactly brand new, but really nice. Location is perfect, right on the beach. You can see waves breaking just meters off the dining area. The food is plentiful and fresh, although you can find a whole lot of local restaurants within 5-10 minutes walk which will save you money. The pool is clean and safe, we made good use of it during our stay. But the best thing about the place is the staff. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in making our stay fun and comfortable and going above and beyond of what's expected from the palace like this. We highly recommend this resort to everyone and will certainly be back.Read more"
5.0,"Beautiful in every way and the staff cannot do enough to make your stay memorable. They all go out of their way to provide for your every need. The pool is so clean and is amazing. There is no better way to enjoy sipping on a cocktail watching the sun set in the horizon across the Andaman Sea, My room overlooks the ocean and is quiet, beautifully appointed, with the most comfortable bed I have slept in. I cannot speak highly enough of this place.Read more"
5.0,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary staying at Chongfah in a beautiful beach front villa. We cannot speak highly enough of our experience here. As well travelled people, we experienced exemplary service from the staff. The hotel was immaculate at all times. Included breakfast was superb. Location terrific. We plan on returning next year with the family. We were greeted by Jai on arrival who’s calm demeanour and capable approach to all things made our stay so enjoyable. Soo and Yada greeted us each morning with gorgeous greetings and smiles and remembered our coffee orders. In the afternoons for happy hour May and Mook giggles and smiles and even delivered our cocktails to us in the pool one afternoon during a tropical afternoon storm.  :)Ni and her team did an incredible job of our room twice a day. When we arrived our outdoor spa was already filled with water and fragrant leaves and flowers. They decorated our bed daily with pandanus bouquets and could not have been any more helpful. For all seven days we were treated like royalty. The hotel is a casual 1km flat stroll to the Bang Niang markets, or use the hotel shuttle or free push bikes. There are restaurants, bars and street food all within a walk. The beach is only able to be walked on during low tide but the sunsets are incredible every day. We walked a huge distance north during low tide and it was calm relaxing and safe. Highly recommend.Read more"
5.0,"A last minute trip away for some time out and choosing to stay here was the best decision.I can only agree with the reviews written by others who also enjoyed their experience at Chongfah.Location was ideal, size of the resort just right, the bungalow had everything one would need and all the meals I had at the restaurant were very tasty and good value. All staff were exceptional - friendly, caring and very genuine about making sure my stay was special.Read more"
5.0,"It’s been one day since our five night Chongfah holiday ended. We are now in a big city hotel while visiting friends. Am I missing waking to the sound of waves breaking outside my seaside bungalow? Yes. Am I missing the wonderful amenities included with that bungalow? Yes. Am I missing the most amazing breakfast choices I may have ever been offered? Yes. Am I missing excellent sunset meals at that same restaurant? Yes. You can read the many reviews about all of these and all of them a part of my five-star rating. So what do I miss the most? I miss the staff and the guests. I miss Zel (more about her later) greeting me in the morning as I step out of the bungalow to enjoy the morning. I miss Yado’s smile and warm greeting as he seats me for the included breakfast. Each day I would enjoy a coffee latte while waiting for my to join me. I also miss a lovely family of five visiting from Brussels and dining with us twice. When grandparents are separated from grandchildren, they enjoy the company of children. By the way, all of the staff at this small property were fantastic. I do not have one complaint. When my wife and I began making plans to celebrate our 43rd wedding anniversary I began considering Phuket. My son suggested Khao Lak. It was a great suggestion. I began reading Trip Advisor and some other reviews. I watched some YouTube videos. I quickly decided Khao Lak was the place. After making our reservation, I messaged Chongfah on Facebook. For over two months we conversed about our holiday. On arrival I learned that I had been messaging with the very personal Zel. She was readily available to make sure this experience was perfect...and it was perfect. The location was ideal for us. For the time we chose to not relax at Chongfah we were a 5-10 minute safe walk (day or night) to a massage (we went to Bussada Massage four times), shopping, many good restaurants, and the enjoyable Bang Niang Market. You should not be surprised to read that we plan to return...possibly next year.Read more"
5.0,3years later we came back this hotel. It was good as usual. friendly staff.  warm welcome. Quality Breakfast. Thank you Chongfah Team. always make our stay relaxed. definitely will be back again. From Bernard & EvaRead more
5.0,We visited in August 2018 and the hotel and facilities were fantastic! Although it rained alot while we were there unfortunately it still was such an amazing stay! The staff go out of their way to make your stay! The morning breakfast we have included in our stay and is also very good and you can order off the menu what you would like! Perfect! We also did the cooking class there and it was very fun! Definitely would recommend and would be back.Read more
5.0,Me and my family (my youngest son is 16) are staying at this small but beautiful resort for five nights. The staff is extremly friendly and service oriented and the breakfast is great. Large and clean rooms with nice bathrooms. The pool area is very relaxed and is located right by the Andaman Sea. The hotel has an adult touch to it and I would not recommend it for families with small kids. The hotel is probably the comfiest we have ever stayed at!Read more
5.0,"We spent a lovely few days in this amazing resort. The rooms were excellent, the pool has an amazing view. The service was some of the best I have ever experienced. If you are planning a trip to enjoy peace and quiet in lovely surroundings give this place a look you will not regret it!Read more"
5.0,"great small/boutique resort.location is nice but the staff really makes the difference! they're all helpful and always kind, smiling and ready to make sure you have everything needed.Food is very good, the highlight being the breakfast: great quality and variety!Special thank you to Zel for incredible hospitality.Read more"
5.0,Superb Boutique Hotel. Courteous staff and excellent accomodation and food. I had a Ocean Facing Room on the first floor of the Main Block and found it perfect. Very quiet location bang in front of the Ocean. Heaven on EarthRead more
5.0,An amazing resort with super friendly staff who are always willing to help. Good breakfast spread and lovely pool. Easy access to a lot of restaurants and massage places.Love that it is also doing its bit for the environment.Read more
5.0,"We stayed here for a week over Easter - us being myself, my Thai wife, our baby daughter, and my sister and nephew who joined us from Germany. From the moment we arrived, we were wowed by the friendliness and attention to detail of the team. Zel and the other staff greeted us warmly, and couldn't get enough of holding our baby girl to give us a few moments of respite after a long drive.Both our rooms had been lovingly prepared with customised welcome messages made from blossoms and flower stems. We also found a beautiful wooden baby cot, as well as a little baby bath tub in the shower. Zel left us to settle in, and told us to ask should we require anything else whatsoever.The fantastic service is what made this stay so special, and differentiated it from the many other hotel experiences we've had, both in Thailand and elsewhere. For starters, we were always greeted on a first name basis by all staff. Makes a huge difference knowing that we were more than just a room number.A couple of other examples of the great service:  when we noticed some dirt in the kids pool one morning. Upon information staff, the hotel engineer arrived within 10 minutes with a suction pump and gave it a thorough clean. On the third morning, Zel approached us at breakfast to ask if everything was ok. We mentioned that the kids had gotten a couple of mosquito bites overnight. We were immediately offered a mosquito net, and every day thereafter, staff lit two mosquito repellent incense pots outside both of our rooms, twice daily. No more bites since!The breakfast menu also deserves a special mention - it offered a range of warm Western and Thai dishes, 6 types of bread with various cheeses, cold meats and jams, muesli, yoghurt, and even sushi, as well as 10 or so fresh fruit juices and a selection of fresh exotic fruits, all of which changed daily to avoid too much repetition. Best of all are the omelette and waffle/pancake stations, which are made freshly to guest's specifications, and brought to their tables.As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel beach is quite small and only accessible to kids during low tide. However, there are a couple of nice beaches within easy walking distance (10 minute casual stroll), and the hotel pool is great. All this directly on the seashore, with amazing views day and night, yet only a 10 minute walk or short tuk til ride to local convenience stores, bars, restaurants, massage parlours and more.We were definitely very happy with our stay here, and will gladly come back to Chongfah when we are in Khao Lak again.Read more"
5.0,"Our decision to stay at Chong Fah was largely swayed by the very positive reviews on Trip Advisor – which we would agree with!After staying at a larger resort in Krabi for 8 nights, Chong Fah felt a bit small when we arrived – but this feeling disappeared very quickly!This is one of the most tranquil and relaxing places we have ever stayed and we can understand why people come back year after year.We had a seafront villa for 6 nights which was only a few meters back from the sea wall and crashing waves.We had a couple of sun loungers just in front – underneath a couple of palm trees. The perfect spot to read and catch some sun.The main restaurant/bar is a short walk away and again just a few meters back from the sea.The buffet breakfast was excellent – with lovely fresh fruit and pretty much anything else you could think of. Very good coffee too.The pool was lovely too – with stunning sea views and a great place to enjoy a sundowner!This boutique hotel has a special atmosphere created by the amazing setting combined with the excellent staff!Genuinely warm and hospitable – and we would like to say a huge thank you to Yada, Roger, Zel, Toom and the rest of the team for making our stay so special! Nothing was too much trouble.We celebrated my 50th birthday at Chong Fah and the staff helped to make it a very special day indeed.While we were at breakfast, house-keeping decorated our bed “Happy Birthday” style and it looked amazing!In the evening, the team set a special table on the terrace and Jimmy (the Chef) prepared a special crab curry (my favourite) which was absolutely superb.The sea is powerful here and the sea wall is required to keep the crashing waves at bay. Sometimes (at high tide) the waves would splash over the sea wall!We loved the noise of the sea but others may not.If you want the beach, you need to head north or south. At very low tide you can get to the beaches easily from the hotel. Most other times you need to walk by road – which was fine for us.The Northern beach (5 mins walk away) is lovely to walk on. White sand and goes on for miles. A real paradise feel.The Southern beach (10 mins walk away – because you have to zig-zag) is very nice too but more bars/hotels visible from the beach.Overall the resort location suited us well. Close to the sea and very tranquil.The various beach resorts we saw were set back a fair way from the sea. They looked nice but on balance we preferred our location.Also, you were a short walk or Tuk Tuk ride away from loads of restaurants, bars and massage parlours.Last but not least, our room was lovely. A very comfy bed, spacious bathroom and great aircon.We will definitely be returning to Chong Fah! It is a very special and relaxing place.Read more"
5.0,"We stayed here for two weeks. It was wonderful. We stayed in the garden bungalows. Room was spacious and bed large. Had a outside shower and bath too - there is an inside shower too.Pool was fab - infinity pool overlooking the ocean with jacuzzi jets on the other side of the pool. Cocktail hour was spent in the pool drinking. Such fun.Breakfasts were excellent - wide choice from coooing station for any type of eggs, to a selection of different breads, cheese, cold meat. The juices are amazing : passion fruit, guava, watermelon, lychee, papaya and more. The fruit selection is great too - I will miss this each morning that is for sure! Watermelon, papaya, pineapple, melon, mango - yum!Staff were amazing. They go out their way to make you feel special. Call outs are for Zel, Amy, Roger and Yada - but in fairness all staff are excellent.Day trips to Surin Islands (3 snorkelling stops) was outstanding. Excellent visibility and large range of fish seen. Lovely beach stop for lunch.Day trip to the Kam Islands. Beautiful unspoilt beaches and some beaches we were the only ones on it! Lunch was delicious - one of my best meals here in fact. Snorkelling was sadly not possible that day due to poor visibility. However, the upside was that we saw a school of dolphins - not once but twice was we were sailing between the islands! The lunch stop has a view point you can climb too - but be careful as it is slippery but you have lots of tree branches to steady yourself.Tsunami museum - confronting but very educating. Two rooms to see - upstairs is the video which is very moving.Moo Moo cabaret was such fun. It is a lady boy show. Energetic, fun and outrageous - can highly recommend! Speak to Yada who will book you a table. We got great seats. It is free and you buy drinks and tip the performers afterwards.We took a taxi to White Sand Beach. Big restaurant with many sun loungers you can hire (150 bhat for two) and the taxi was (350 bhat each way). Lovely beach and calm sea to swim in. You can take long beach walks here on either side of the sunloungers.Turtle sanctuary - on a naval base and where you can see the police boat which washed up onto the land. The turtles are amazing and there is a deserted beach there too. Well worth a look. The hotel offers free rides there every Tues.Restaurants we can recommend are:Green pepper (Thai)Thai corner (Thai)Siam (Thai)Amici (Italian- the fungi pizza infused with truffle oil was delicious)Pinocchio (Italian - tuna salad was huge and delicious)Rusty Pelican (Mexican)Chongfah resort hotel (Thai - liked various dishes here and they had a lovely nasi goreng).Thank you Chongfah resort for an amazing holiday. You are the best!!Read more"
5.0,"Love this hotel, absolutely gorgeous place to stay. We spent a week in a Seaview Bungalow, and it is unbelievably well designed. So comfortable. My main objective was to remember how to sit still and do absolutely nothing, happy to say I did manage to do this. I also spent a lot of time in the fantastic pool. Location is good as well. And not to mention the outstanding staff. And the great happy hour where you actually get to meet others staying at the hotel and of course enjoy the excellent sea view. The only let down is the restaurant. Such a pity as such a prime spot. Would be good to see the restaurant serve top notch Thai tucker as this is sadly lacking in nearby restaurants and many of the guests at the hotel were a bit older and did not want to eat pizza or Mexican, but real, proper Thai food which used to be all you could find in Thailand. If the restaurant improved and served good Thai, I'd be happy to return for another sit still and enjoy the serenity holiday!Read more"
5.0,"I don’t know even where to start with describing how wonderful this hotel is. All the staff are fabulous, they make you feel so special and go out of their way to help you with everything, you never have to wait for anything and are properly pampered. The restaurant Seaborn is fabulous, we ate there 4 nights out of 6 and the two nights we didn’t we wished we had! The steak night was particularly good I had a fabulous tuna steak and my husband had tenderloin both cooked to perfection! We stayed in both a sea view bungalow and a garden bungalow. Both were great, but I would highly recommend the sea view bungalows for the view. I said to my husband on our second day “I feel sorry for anyone who never gets to stay here” I was so upset to have to check out. Book it you will not be sorry.Read more"
5.0,"Our second time in Khao Lak, first at Chongfah and it won't be our last!I had read the reviews on TA and wondered how there could be so many amazing reviews. Staff:They are so high in customer service and really couldn't do enough for us.Picked up by Roger head of food and beverages from our original accommodation. Friendly,  professional and informative. Receptionists - Zel was outstanding,  even giving us water bottles to take out on walks without being asked. Amy,  continuously checking how we were. All staff friendly,  waving and smiling 😁View:Wonderful sunsets over the sea. Infiniti pool beautiful, however, on our first day my husband slipped on the very shiny, slippery steps and is still, 3.5 weeks later sporting a huge bruise and thinks he may have chipped a bone in his arm. Some grit or slip strips wouldn't go amiss. The beach walk is only very limited due to tides,  these are posted each morning in the restaurant. It would be nice to have a mutual agreement with the Mukdara for guests to walk through. We had to swim to Chongfah steps once when the tide came in!Great mini mart across the road for all your needs. Food:The breakfast choices were outstanding! As I suffer from food intolerances and also don't eat meat I thought I would struggle. Absolutely not! I didn't even need to let them know as there were so many options; 8 fruit juices, cereals, breads,  condiments,  salads,  cheese,  noodles etc.,  egg station, pancake station plus an additional menu! Dinner menu we weren't as impressed with (Asian buffet), would suggest that they made everything to order to ensure that dishes were hot (especially tempura and kebabs). Pad Thai was lovely as was the fish soup. Lunch was the usual offerings done to a good standard but expensive, as all resorts tend to be. Happy hour cocktails 2 for 1 good with view to die for. Housekeeping,  really good with excellent turn down service. Suggest that glass or reusable sustainable 'Chongfah' bottles replace the plastic ones and get a large water filtered one to fill up from in reception/ restaurant etc. Good branding choice and means your advertising works for you when guests return overseas. Comfortable bed and good pillow menu (recommend the gel cool one)Wifi good if required. Loved the eco aware status. A trip to the turtle sanctuary was enjoyable (baby seats available on the bus).Great location in high season, we'd be interested to know which restaurants and shops are open during green season as this is when we have previously travelled to Khao Lak.All in all,  please keep doing what you are doing. Our grown up children are thinking of visiting with their partners. 5 star Chongfah! See you again xRead more"
5.0,Stayed for 7 nights in this great hotel which has a beautiful  infinity pool overlooking the sea. From the pool or the adjacent bar we saw some amazing sunsets whilst enjoying happy hour cocktails. Breakfast was varied and we had the most beautiful eggs cooked to order each day. The spring rolls we had for lunch were the best we have ever had. We had dinner in the restaurant on two evenings including the Chinese New Year gala dinner. The food was of the highest standard. Wine in the hotel was expensive but that is true in most Thailand restaurants.One slight negative was lack of a beach at high tide but it still was easy to swim in the sea. Great place and very enjoyable stay.Read more
5.0,"From the friendliness of the staff to the wonderful rooms and fantastic breakfast I cannot fault this hotel. We were a group of four adults and stayed 5 nights. This is a quiet resort  with no loud music, just the sound of the sea and birds. The infinity pool was a delight, plenty big enough to swim lengths or simply enjoy the vista.The variety and freshness of the breakfast is lovely, there's a pancake or waffle station and an egg station cooked fresh. Loads of fruits, yoghurts, great bread selection, jams, cold meats, cheeses, salads, hot choices both Asian and English. Plentiful supply of bathroom and beach thick very large towels. There's a never ending supply of hot water in super wet rooms which back onto the quiet road therefore muffling any road traffic in rooms. We ate in hotel some nights but did find the local restaurants and bars much cheaper and all within few minutes walking distance. Free bikes available at hotel in good condition, cycling much cooler way to get around than walking. The reception staff helped us book a boat captain to take us snorkling to a local reef which was great and a much cheaper than booking through tour company, we paid 1000bt each for a trip from 9 am to 2pm including lunch.Thoroughly recommend staying here, only small but great personal service and location.Read more"
5.0,From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. The staff remember your name and room numberNothing is too much trouble. Rooms are cleaned properly with nightly turndown service with a sweet treat. Often there is a towel left in the shape of something. The bed was adorned with petals on arrival saying welcome. You are checked in by Zell the chief host and she comes to chat every day asking if she can do anything for us. There is as much bottled water as you can drink and plenty of towels for the room and beachWe were given a complimentary set dinner on the second night and the Asian Buffet was spectacular both visually and taste wise. Absolutely delicious with fresh delicacies from Japan Vietnam China and Thailand. The Tom Yum soup was the best I have ever tasted  I cannot recommend this place enoughRead more
5.0,"I've been to Khao Lak several times and have always stayed at bigger resorts (Le Meridian when it was there and then the Ramada- which is actually Chongfah's sister resort I found out when there). The friend I was travelling with found chongfah online and I'm so glad stayed there. The resort is small- only 30 rooms not that it even seems that big and it was perfect for my friend and I. Although on the water, it's not a far stroll from restaurants and shops etc so you are not at all isolated. The pool is lovely and I was very happy lying by it enjoying delicious Pina Colada's. (It's surprising how many places can't make a decent pina colada- and I do judge a resort by it- chongfah passes with an A+++). If you want a big sandy beach- this isn't your place. There is a small beach accessible by stairs but the majority of the resort (while waterfront) doesn't have a beach along the front. The breakfasts are lovely and in true Thai style presented beautifully (the uniformity of the cut papaya is amazing- ok you're not going to chose a resort on how they cut their fruit- but it highlights the detail they go to). The air-con in the rooms is fantastic too- quiet and keeps the room very cool (which is how I prefer to sleep). I stayed there with a friend, but this would be a lovely resort for a romantic getaway too.Read more"
5.0,One of the best hotels that I have ever stopped in.  The beachfront location is superb and the staff cannot do enough for you.  The rooms are well equipped and a great size.The bar and more importantly - Happy Hour are just great!Will returnRead more
5.0,"We stayed at Chongfah in August 2018 for two weeks. First time visitors to Chongfah, many times to Khao Lak area. Simply loved our stay!!! Super Thai friendly service, beautiful staff, excellent ocean front location.The Hotel; Located on the ocean a short walk from the main road of shops and restaurants. Only 30 rooms set in three rows of rooms. We were ocean front and enjoyed every minute relaxing to the sound of waves crashing into the seawall. No direct beach access from the front of the room as there is a seawall - but not a problem for us - green season Andaman Sea is quite rough for swimming. We just enjoy the salt spray and sound of the surf. The Hotel is small and very personal service. The staff greeted us by name every day, the front desk and/or the food & beverage manager spoke with us every morning at breakfast to see if they could do anything to enhance our stay, and teach us a few Thai words! We were not expecting the high level of service at such a small property, and felt comfortable and well taken care of during our entire stay. A pleasant surprise of excellent service. We enjoyed the excursion to the turtle sanctuary and the swimming pool. Decent wifi in the main areas of the resort - in the room the speed was slower depending on time of day (other guests). The Room: As noted we stayed in the ocean front villa room. Absolute ocean front with crashing waves and gorgeous sunsets. The room was very clean and serviced twice daily by the friendly housekeeping staff.  Large room with plenty of storage closet, separate bathing area, and outdoor spa tub and shower. Bluetooth speaker, LCD TV, and refrigerator in the room. We don't do 'minibar' and the staff kindly removed the items to free up space for our waters and beverages. Cold aircon - once it got going, (as with many lodgings in the high electric cost areas the aircon only runs when you place the room key to activate). Several bottles of purified drinking water were provided daily and refilled at request. We loved the different turn down service 'snacks' of Thai treats in the evening. Linens and towels were of very good quality and the pillow menu a nice touch. Kudos to the staff who setup our sun loungers with towels every morning and lit the mossie stick on the patio. The Food: We were very pleased with the rate included breakfast. Excellent choices from the menu a la carte and a nice buffet spread and served in the restaurant or on the patio overlooking the ocean. Expresso beverages and juices included. We rarely dined in the restaurant for dinners - there are many dining options in Khao Lak and we wanted to try them. Occasionally we would order a light meal at Chongfah before happy hour. Excellent service, manager, and staff, great ocean side location.All things considered we had a very enjoyable stay at Chongfah and recommend a visit. Excellent staff and service level was very personalized and attentive, thank you Pancake and Roger and the rest of the staff for a relaxing holiday.Read more"
4.0,The staff at this hotel are really among the most helpful and charming ever. They really want you to have a good time! The room was very comfortable and we slept like logs. The sunsets were wonderful and with cooling sea breezes it was just great. The only drawback is that the hotel sits on a concrete bulwark to hold back the sea and you can only get down to the beach by either scrambling down rickety steps or going out to the road at the front and walking a couple of hundred yards.Read more
4.0,We had 5 days here to relax after some hectic touring and it pretty much ticked all the boxes.There is a small beach to the side but really the dedicated vegging out takes place on the sun loungers around the splendid infinity pool and those looking out to sea.There was always plenty of loungers.The food quality was good  ( we had lunch here most days) especially the breakfast which was first rate and with for example a different range of fruit most mornings.A minor whinge is the rather unpleasant butter ( yes I know it’s a big ask to get better but you have high standards ! ) which spoils the good brown bread on offer.Lovely staff all all round.The bungalows are fine and with fans and aircon.Good WiFi.Read more
5.0,"This is a beautiful little hotel in an excellent location. We had a garden bungalow, complete with outdoor private Jacuzzi. The rooms are very comfortable with good AC and as much bottled water as you can drink (possibly more). The breakfasts are again excellent and the staff are superb. I always think breakfast overlooking the sea is a lovely way to start the day. We took advantage of the Turtle Sanctury trip on our final day as we had a late flight and it was a good way to spend the morning...especially when the only charge was entrance! I think that the fact that we were provided with a late check out...without asking and without charge, says a great deal for this hotel!Read more"
5.0,"Truly the best hotel I've ever stayed in; the kindness of the staff and the service they provide, the big beautiful room, the beach view, the extensive breakfast, the amazing food (diner), and I could go on. Nothing is too much to ask, it's very clean and beautiful. I would go back in an instant and would recommend anyone to going hereRead more"
5.0,Stayed with a baby 3 weeks in september. Low season which means empty resort and some maintenance work. We had a great stay. Very well maintained resort and a relaxing pool area. Important as we could not swim in the ocean due to high waves. The staff is wonderful. You really feel taken care of. Attention to details and great with kids.Read more
5.0,"Honestly a fine hotel. We were relocated here due to the Ramada renovation. Stayed in a Garden Bungalow and what a spacious room. Outside Jacuzzi and Shower and internal separate bathroom.A big shout out to all the staff here from the receptionists, maids to the restaurant staff. Always friendly and willing to assist. A special mention to Khun Pancake who was always checking n things and giving us the smile that Thailand is known for.Food is great with an a'la carte breakfast and buffet. Choose freshly prepared dishes off the menu to compliment your buffet selection. Coffee is fresh and some of the best i have had in Thailand.Would I go back.....without a doubt. good job Team Chong Fah.Read more"
5.0,"This is our final night of a six night stay and  this resort has exceeded our high expectations. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted like royalty with flower leis, welcome drink, snacks and even sandwiches as we arrived late evening; all staff, from reception to housekeeping to restaurant, are welcoming and friendly, greeting you by name and anticipating your every need; our sea view bungalow was spacious and comfortable with a great espresso pod machine for early morning coffee; the restaurant food was excellent and so well priced, we didn’t bother going out to eat- great 2 for 1 cocktails too; the infinity pool was clean and a perfect temperature for daily swims; there were little treats every afternoon at bed turndown time. What an absolute pleasure it has been to holiday here at this divine piece of paradise where their only wish is for you to be happy!Read more"
5.0,"I stayed overnight in Chongfah Beach Resort with a group of friends just 1 night when joining our friend's wedding in Khaolak. This was the first time I visited this resort. Due to the green season, the price is so special offer. During my stay everything in the hotel were exceeding my expectation. Upon check-in,  nice and friendly receptionists welcomed me with smiles and served a welcome drink with a small cup of coconut jelly. Next I got a Seaview Bungalow with full set up of  amenities, WOW! Actually I didn't expect anything much, but they made me feel special then.The Seaview Bungalow equipped with all necessary things you need like having beach holiday at home: comfortable beds, a warm sofa with cushions, an espresso machine, a beach bag, an umbrella if raining, a seating area at the front and just two steps to the sunlougers overlooking the beach. Just one night stay, I had a super relax weekend here. I went to swim twice with friends in resort's pool; enjoyed taking a bath in the private jacuzzi with the lemongrass ELLE Spa set; slept very well after the wedding party in quiet atmosphere, and had late breakfast with a number of Thai and Western food selections!Just two things I missed as I don't have enough time to try: the Happy Hour in Sunset evening and the massage. Only one and a half hour driving from where I live in Phuket, I am pretty sure I will stay longer there next time and I will try all.Read more"
5.0,"My boyfriend and myself woke up one morning and decided to drive over to Khao Lak to relax for a day and we decided on Chong Fah as it was the #1 hotel in the ranking and it was worth every single cent!From the moment we stepped in to the day we checked out, the staffs made us feel so welcomed and warm. We were greeted by Pancake (she is definitely the hotel's asset!) and she is amazing. She is attentive and always so friendly. We got the sea facing villa (please book this if you can!) and the room has everything we need. It even comes with Jacuzzi and an outdoor shower (can't believe I forgot to take pictures!). Bed and pillow were comfortable and we slept with the door opened, to the sound of the waves. It was low season but we got 2 days of sun. Yes, we were very lucky. Pool was fantastic but I didn't see any baby/kids pool around. Our package was half-board. Dinner was nothing worth shouting for but it was nice enough for us -  authentic local thai food. Breakfast is a la carte and prepared by chef.One night was too short for this beautiful resort and beach. We are definitely coming back and Chong Fah will be our only choice.Read more"
5.0,"This place is AMAZING. We just visited for 6 nights in August so it was out of season but still a full compliment of staff who are the most professional people I have ever met... and the nicest. They could do no better at all. The check in was fantastic where two lovely ladies, one called Pancake attended to our every need and showed us our quite frankly out of this world room. We had a seafront bungalow which had the most fantastic views and brilliant facilities. The pillow menu was also a great touch. The bed was wonderful and the jacuzzi fab! We ordered room service on the first night after a long flight and it came promptly and with a smile, and was delicious. There was a good selection at breakfast including a hot option with Roger overseeing that everything was ok. Lovely man. Anything we asked for was met with a smile and was sorted for us. Service is first class. The resort is small and so friendly with waves and cheery hellos from everyone as we went by. The pool is delightful with an amazing sea view. I needed to use a gym on the holiday and popped into a hotel nearby to ask if I could use their’s to be met with utter rudeness, so not all hotels are the same in this area. Chongfah is by far the best place we have ever stayed by a mile...oh and the airport pick up is also great, to be met with a smile and an air conditioned car with leather massaging seats was a real treat. If you are going to Khao Lak, other hotels may be larger but I don’t see how any could be as good as this. Book this hotel...it’s AMAZING. Thank you for a wonderful stay.Read more"
5.0,"Beautiful view, amazing  team, good restaurant and breakfast , lovely swimming  pool. We came for 4 nights and stay for a week.   Very very clean room . The best hotel  we stayed in ThailandThe team was so sensitive to all our needsRead more"
5.0,"My husband and I returned to Chongfha in March/April of this year and were not disappointed. This boutique hotel still evokes a feeling of relaxation and tranquility. The staff here cannot do enough for you and because this is a relatively small hotel you are not just a room number, you feel a valued guest. The sea view bungalows, where have your own sun beds, are immaculately clean with air conditioning, ceiling fans, tea and coffee facilities and mini bar.Considering the size of Chongfah, the breakfast choices are excellent and should cater for every palate. Unlike some of the larger hotels where the prices are so much higher than in the town of Khao Lak, the lunch and dinner menu is reasonably priced and the food is of excellent quality. All is cooked fresh so don’t expect the speed of a fast food restaurant. We had visited Khao Lak before our first time at Chongfah, but we have been so happy here that we could not stay at any other hotel in this location. I would like to finish this review by sending our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to all the staff who welcomed us and made our stay so wonderful, particularly Pancake and Roger and his team.Read more"
5.0,"We stayed here for 5 days only - but longer would have been betterStaff is fantastic: warm hearted, caring, attentive and friendly. It would not be fair mentioning individual names as all of them (including the trainees!) were truly great.  We believe that the owner spent the Songkran at the location as well and we were amazed how genuinely  friendly staff, owner and guests engaged with each other and celebrated this event. We will miss the wonderful breakfasts, our quick lunches and nice diners with fabulous sunsets. Rooms: spacious, clean and comfy Mattress not too soft or hard. Fantastic  selection of pillows. Pool towels provided Bathroom spacious with common equipment and a ""rainforest"" shower with good temperature and water pressure. Pool large enough for the number of guests.Slight caveat is that when the tide is high, beach access is not recommended. Would we rebook? - definitely.Read more"
5.0,"This is the best hotel that I've ever stayed in Thailand. Room type One-Bedroom Bungalow with Sea View is very lovely room and located in front of the beautiful sea. And every foods are awesome, very delicious, excellent sanitary. And the all staffs here are friendly, well trained, excellent hospitality. I can highly recommend this hotel :)Read more"
5.0,"I visited this boutique style hotel with my husband, deciding on this hotel due to previous reviews. We weren't disappointed, if you are looking for peace, quiet, no rush for sun beds, no queues at the breakfast buffet, on the seafront then this is the place. We opted to stay in a beachfront bungalow and although I never saw any other rooms these were outstanding. The staff were the kindest I had ever come across, I was ill for 24 hours and the staff made a special diet for me. A cut above the rest, definitely worth a return visit .Read more"
5.0,"We stayed here for a week and absolutely loved our stay! From the moment we arrived, we could literally feel our stress ebbing away as the staff and resort are all aimed at making you feel as comfortable as possible.I had a minor mishap on the way to the resort as I lost my ATM card but the staff were extremely helpful in helping me to get things resolved. From there it was bliss as we checked into our room and relaxed for the week! We stayed in one of the non-ocean view rooms on the 2nd floor but didn’t feel like we missed the ocean view at all. The room itself was nicely decorated and again was set up to make us feel as comfortable as possible.The resort grounds are beautiful with a great infinity pool that looks out onto the ocean. We saw some beautiful sunsets as the sun reflects off the pool so be sure to catch it at least once. I'm always a little bit skeptical about resort photos as they often don't live up to reality, but the resort really is as beautiful as it is in pictures.The breakfast buffet is extensive and shouldn’t be missed. We also ate lunch several times during our stay and while it was a little bit on the expensive side, it’s a decent option if you’re too tired to wander into town. It’s about a 5-10 minute walk to the main drag which was perfect in our opinion — close enough to be convenient to the restaurants and shops but far away enough from the hustle to not interfere with the tranquility of our stay.The resort doesn’t have a beach per se but Bang Niang beach is easily accessible during low tide in the afternoons. It’s a simple walk down a short flight of stairs. If you choose to go to the beach earlier during the day, bikes are available from the resort and it’s just a short five minute ride away. Nang Thong Beach is another nice beach further south, a vigorous 20 minutes away by bike. White Sand Beach is another nice beach near the resort which has the benefit of having fewer people but is about 15 minutes away by taxi.To save the best for last, the staff here are absolutely wonderful and the best we came across while in Thailand. The manager is a lovely, sweet woman who really took care of us while we were there. Every morning we were greeted by the smiles of the staff which really made us feel welcome.Although I don’t know when we’ll be back in Khao Lak, we’ll definitely be staying at the Chongfah Resort whenever we return!Read more"
5.0,"On arriving at the resort we received a very warm welcome, being presented with garlands of flowers, coconut jelly and a drink.We stayed in a large, well equipped and well decorated room with a good sized  verandah in this boutique hotel. It had a king size bed and a walk-in shower. At the heart of the resort is the restaurant, and an infinity pool, which overlook the Andaman Sea. There are steps down to the beach which you can only really access at low tide.There are also loads of other restaurants within a few minutes walk. We ate in The Green Pepper and Pinocchio's - both of which were very good. The resort and facilities are all beautiful and well-maintained, but the outstanding feature has got to be the amazing, happy and helpful staff, who obviously love working there. Everyone, from the receptionists and restaurant staff to the housekeepers were attentive and always had a smile on their face.We ate in the restaurant a number of times, and the food was always excellent and reasonably priced. One evening we attended their Asian Buffet and we informed them that my wife has a seafood allergy - they went out of their way to ensure that all staff were aware and either cooked her food separately, or let her know what was safe to eat. If you have a similar requirement, let them know on arrival.When we eventually had to leave, the reception staff even came out to wave us goodbye!Read more"
5.0,"What an amazing time I had at this lovely beach resort! The resort itself was located near a nice long stretch of a beach. The staff was very friendly, helpful & attentive.The room was clean, spacious and kept tidy and clean, and the minibar was stocked up regularly.Commute to nearby beaches was easy to arrange, as was the round day boat trip to nearby islands.The stay included delightful breakfast with enough healthy and delicious options to choose from. In addition there were several beach-side bars and restaurants in a walking distance from hotel to enjoy watching the sunset on the beach.Overall very satisfied, and I I was to return to Khao Lak I don't think I would look for any other hotel.Read more"
5.0,"We fell in love with this little resort.Resort is close to the city centre (walking distance, but taxis are around). A bungalow right at the sea, service with a smile from breakfast till dinner (and for the cocktails in between), good facilities in the bungalow (big bathroom, jacuzzi, WIFI), coffee machine, private terrace, sunbeds, it is all there..Quality of the food in the restaurant is top notch. Thai food really good, but best was the steak on Wednesday BBQ night. Been a really long time since we eat steaks this quality. Excellent prepared to our liking...I can not comment on swimming in the sea from the resort or activities nearby as we went for diving most of the days. But if you go for a holiday in Khao Lak, easy choice.. go for ChongFahRead more"
5.0,"Stayed here for 6 nights March/April From the moment we walked through the door we were welcomed like part of the family.We were upgraded to a private villa with pool and jacuzzi which was lovely.The Hotel looks great and the staff cannot do enough for you. The breakfast offering is great, loads of choice and attentive staff.  And the view is definitely a great way to start your day.  We also ate at the hotel on a couple of nights and could not fault it at all. There is quiet beaches a short walk north, and slightly more busier beaches to the south, but the location of where the hotel is  just perfect.  Worth a stay, and we will try and go back here.Read more"
5.0,"Based on the reviews on Trip Advisor, we knew that the hotel would be excellent but from the moment that we arrived the Chongfah exceeded our expectations. Our top floor room was very spacious & the furnishings & decor were lovely. The Chongfah is in a really good location with steps down to the beach & very close to lots of bars, restaurants, shops & Bang Niang night market. The restaurant, which serves breakfast, lunch & dinner overlooks the beach & has happy hour between 5pm - 6.30pm (buy one & get one free). All of the staff are extremely friendly & helpful and are a credit to the hotel. As there are only 30 rooms there was never a problem getting a sunbed. We also used the hotel to book a half day tour to the Little Amazon (canoe ride), visit to Takuapa, Tsunami Memorial & 2 temples, which was a great day out & the tour company (Milestone) were excellent. If you want a relaxing & peaceful holiday then this is the hotel for you. We would have no hesitation in going back there. The beach can be cut off at high tide but we did not find that a problem as information regarding the tides is avaiable in the dining room. There is a good choicd of hot & cold food at breakfast time.Read more"
5.0,Very attentive staff from arrival to departure. Bar / restaurant staff amazing Nothing too much trouble Short walk into town and also left to beach bar and massages. Loved our stay x thank you to Nunu and Pea xxPool is just lovely especially if no one else wishes to share!!!
5.0,The hotel is on the beach. The pool overlooks the ocean. Beautiful sunsets. Great breakfast. Rooms are nice. BUT the best thing is the staff-- they all care about the guest all the time. This is extremely rare at the price point.
4.0,We stayed here 5 years ago and loved it so decided  to stay again but after covid it starting to look a little sad the rooms are really good and comfy thai style we had upstairs  balcony with sun lounges great looking out at the ocean over pool the best part of the resort. They offer lots of little extras other places don't. Breakfast was ok but because  not a lot of guests  I think too much waste with buffet  style.  Staff  great easy to walk on the beach and heaps food nearby. would I stay again maybe not but it has a really nice feel and loved my 5 days .
5.0,"The Chong Fah is a real gem of a small, boutique hotel, thoroughly deserving of its 5 star rating. The guest rooms are roomy and beautifully appointed, our beach front room was literally a few meters from the sea and included an outdoor whirlpool bath in addition to the indoor toilet and shower.The staff could not be more friendly and helpful, the domestic staff kept our room immaculately tidy despite our best efforts!The buffet breakfast was excellent and having eaten in for lunch or dinner on several days, we would thoroughly recommend the in house dining experience and food."
5.0,"This was our 5th visit to Chongfah and it’s standards have never dropped. It excels in all aspects, cleanliness, rooms, food and staff etc. It is a small resort with a wonderful family feel. You feel a person and not merely a room number.As this was our first trip since the outbreak of covid I admit to some trepidation, however it was groundless. Although Chongfah was sadly under occupied, we still had a good choice for breakfast, albeit table service. We usually had lunch at the resort and quite often dinner too as the food is so good and is comparable in price to the other restaurants in Bang Niang. We were so well looked after that we left totally relaxed with batteries recharged and looking forward to returning next year. Our grateful thanks to all the staff, especially the lovely ladies who cleaned our bungalow, Kate in reception and Roger, Bea and Cookie from the restaurant.See you next year our friends x"
5.0,After visiting the last time in January 2020 we returned for 10 days over Christmas and New Year. This small boutique hotel is still as excellent as ever. Their location is beautiful and in an lovely spot for beach and other amenities including bars and restaurants. However the hotel can only be rated five-star thanks to all of the brilliant staff they have working here. A special shout out to Kate and the reception team for their support with travel and other plans needed due to Covid. Also a really good restaurant and bar team and the housekeeping support is also first class.
5.0,"This was my husband and my fourth visit to this fantastic resort. It is so good that we would now never go to any other hotel/resort in Khao Lak.It is a small resort with a relaxing, family atmosphere and where you are a person, not just a room number. We are lucky to have travelled extensively and the staff here are the friendliest and most efficient we have come across, and that is everyone from the restaurant and reception to the lovely lady who cleaned our bungalow.There is a nice selection of dishes for breakfast and should you wish to dine there for lunch or dinner, the food is very good and at a reasonable price.At low tide it’s possible to have a long walk along the beach. There is also a lovely infinity pool. The resort is in easy walking distance to Bang Niang town with all its amenities including a twice weekly market.We would like to pass on our thanks to all the staff particularly Yada in reception, Khean the lovely lady who cleaned our bungalow, Pea and May in the restaurant and special thanks to Roger and Sod in the restaurant, it was great to see you again this year."
4.0,"This is a lovely boutique hotel of approx 20 apartments. It has a wonderful infinity pool where you could just spend hours relaxing looking at the sea. The hotel is very much in to eco and therefore is very green in its approach. It is right on the beach and close to many shops and restaurants out side the resort but still nice and quiet. The staff are wonderful, helpful, friendly and very efficient which made the stay so much nicer. I would recommend this hotel and would return given the opportunity."
5.0,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  The staff are excellent.  Kate is a great manager and gave me good advice on a snorkeling trip.  Breakfast has a large number of choices.  A pretty infinity pool overlooks the sea.  Rooms are one floor of a two-story cottage-like structure and have a nice amount of room with a deck or outdoor area (but I'd have to say I never used it).  It's great to have breakfast outside right at seaside, or to use the lounge chairs that line the water front -- a great, peaceful place to relax.  Be aware, however, that there is no beachfront to the hotel (it's just rocks, so you can't access the water).  But you can walk north a block and there is a large beach area, or at the south end of the property there is a tiny little cove with some sand and you can go down to the water there."
5.0,"This is the second time war have been to the Chongfah and we had a wonderful time. The staff cannot do enough for you. It was relaxed and friendly. I celebrated my birthday there and they surprised with with a wonderfully decorated table, flowers from the gardens and even my own birthday cake and hand made card, it absolutely made my day. The quality and quantity of the food was brilliant and the cleanliness outstanding. Roger the manager was very accommodating and his and his staff are to be commended for giving us a memorable holiday. Thank you all"
5.0,"Spent 4 nights at Chongfah this JanuaryLovely bed and breakfast, quietly tucked on the water, while near the townExtensive breakfast. nice and friendly staff. Roger at the restaurant is very helpful and kind. we ate nearly all of our meals here.Great pool, plenty of chairs by the pool or over the water.  There's a sea wall along the edge of the property, but you can walk down the water (note we experienced the little invisible 'stinging' jellies and didn't love the seawater anyway! much preferred the pool)We scheduled poolside massages which was relaxing and affordable at 350b/hr Halfway through our stay we asked to switch rooms - moving from the ground floor to an upstairs room was much better, and gave us a sunny terrace and better airflow. I'd recommend a top floor or water front.Recommend this hotel for a lovely b&b in Khao Lak"
5.0,Just a short review as we just wanted to thank all the staff for their excellent hospitality - they make this hotel a 5 star experience 👍. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation ! It’s a quiet location with access to beach down some steps / has a lovely warm pool and the food in the restaurant is excellent (stops you wanting to go out to nearby restaurants) - also prices for drinks very reasonable and they have a happy hour too !
5.0,"My husband and I stayed at Chong Fah for 5 nights and had a very relaxing stay. The resort setting is beautiful with a large infinity pool looking out to the sea. There are 2 sun lounger areas - round the pool (non smoking) and on the other side of the pool (smoking area) looking out to sea.Our room was also very large, lovely big bed, pillow menu, large bathroom and large covered balcony with 2 sun loungers on - we liked sitting on these watching the view on the afternoons that it rained!Breakfast was good and the most extensive of our stay in Thailand. We ate lunch there most days as the offerings in town weren’t fantastic, as well as a couple of dinners - the food at Chong fah was the best Thai food that we found in Khao Lak and it wasn’t dumbed down for western tastes (which is what we experienced elsewhere in Khao Lak).The hotel also organised transfers for us to and from Phuket airport which was really smooth and comfortable. All in all if you want to relax and chill out with a beautiful view, lovely comfortable rooms and friendly staff, this is the place for you."
5.0,This is a really special hotel to stay at or visit for the day or as we did sunset and cocktails. You just have to use use the toilets to realise how immaculate this place is kept. The staff were so welcoming and the view is incredible. If you want a really peaceful hotel with garden rooms looking over the pool or hotel yet close to the village life then this is the best.
5.0,"Everything positive that you read about this resort in other reviews is true so I won’t repeat it. What I want to share with you is my story which will give you an idea of how exceptional this place is.On my second night here I stumbled and fell. Sod (I believe it’s pronounced Sort) tried to save me ,he was terrified I was going to hit my head. In his attempt to save me he fell with me , I’m positive he must have hurt himself but did not show it.This was my own fault and was not the hotels fault in any shape or form.As I fell I severely broke my ankle, I ended up going to hospital in Phuket. I spent 3 nights in there and had 12 pins and a plate inserted. Sort came with us and helped to translate everything that was going on. He stayed with us until I told him to go home at about 4.30 am in the morning.We could not get hold of our insurance, Sod told me that the hotel had insurance and would happily use it for me all we had to do was pay the excess. I could have kissed him.The next day the owner came to the hospital to see how I was doing and bought me a beautiful flower arrangement and helped me feel confident that the bill was covered.The day after that she came again with a gift bag of biscuits.The food in the hospital was absolutely appalling, worse than the NHS and it was the same company sedexo that do our local hospital food. I asked my partner to ask the hotel if they could do me a sandwich or something. He came with a cheese and ham sandwich and other goodies and no charge. It sounds silly but it was the best sandwich I ever had.They paid for my Taxi to the hotel which was about £75.When I got back , there was a get well card and a message over the bed.The owner lent me a wheel chair and came to see me and ask if there was anything to help with my stay. I asked for some bags to cover my cast and a chair for the shower. When I returned to the room it was there and a table for my things.The hotel is not that easy to get around in a wheel chair but every time a member of the staff saw me they would come running over to help. It seems daft but they seemed to be fighting for the privelidge to help me. Even the chiefs would come running out to help.Nothing but nothing was to much bother, even phoning the room to check that we were all right. They carried me into the hotel, and I am a large lady, I know it hurt them.  4 people once carried me in the wheelchair.As people were helping me the waitress would be getting my table ready. They knew exactly what was working for me, ie they knew which table , they would move a chair out for my wheelchair and put a chair to rest my leg.They did so much for me that I was crying with emotion , they were so thoughtful and considerate. On the last day I was thanking Sod and he said that why would they not help me , this was my home! That summed it up for me , they want you to feel at home.They wear t shirts saying the Chong Fah team. Personally I think it should be changed to the Chong Fah family.I would like to say a massive thank you to everyone , from the owner to the reception staff but I’d like to say a special thank you to Sod, thank you for your time and the calming influence. Thank you for staying with me until 4.30 amRogerThank you for all that you did, for organising people and looking after Richard, for pushing me up a ramp.Yarda,Thank you for carrying me , putting your hands on my waist to steady me. Thank you for catching me when I wobbled.To all the waitresses, I’m sorry I don’t know your names, but thank you all for looking after me and carrying my crutches. Your attention to detail was lovely.This holiday was for my partner’s retirement . I was so upset that I felt it was ruined. Yes we didn’t do what we wanted but we made the most of it and without the love and care from all the staff it would have been totally ruined.We have decided that if we can we will be back in February. I have never gone to the same hotel twice but on this occasion I will be returning to the Chong Fah."
5.0,"We stayed here for two full weeks and had a great time. The place is clean and well-taken care of, it's not exactly brand new, but really nice. Location is perfect, right on the beach. You can see waves breaking just meters off the dining area. The food is plentiful and fresh, although you can find a whole lot of local restaurants within 5-10 minutes walk which will save you money. The pool is clean and safe, we made good use of it during our stay. But the best thing about the place is the staff. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in making our stay fun and comfortable and going above and beyond of what's expected from the palace like this. We highly recommend this resort to everyone and will certainly be back."
5.0,"Beautiful in every way and the staff cannot do enough to make your stay memorable. They all go out of their way to provide for your every need. The pool is so clean and is amazing. There is no better way to enjoy sipping on a cocktail watching the sun set in the horizon across the Andaman Sea, My room overlooks the ocean and is quiet, beautifully appointed, with the most comfortable bed I have slept in. I cannot speak highly enough of this place."
5.0,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary staying at Chongfah in a beautiful beach front villa. We cannot speak highly enough of our experience here. As well travelled people, we experienced exemplary service from the staff. The hotel was immaculate at all times. Included breakfast was superb. Location terrific. We plan on returning next year with the family. We were greeted by Jai on arrival who’s calm demeanour and capable approach to all things made our stay so enjoyable. Soo and Yada greeted us each morning with gorgeous greetings and smiles and remembered our coffee orders. In the afternoons for happy hour May and Mook giggles and smiles and even delivered our cocktails to us in the pool one afternoon during a tropical afternoon storm.  :)Ni and her team did an incredible job of our room twice a day. When we arrived our outdoor spa was already filled with water and fragrant leaves and flowers. They decorated our bed daily with pandanus bouquets and could not have been any more helpful. For all seven days we were treated like royalty. The hotel is a casual 1km flat stroll to the Bang Niang markets, or use the hotel shuttle or free push bikes. There are restaurants, bars and street food all within a walk. The beach is only able to be walked on during low tide but the sunsets are incredible every day. We walked a huge distance north during low tide and it was calm relaxing and safe. Highly recommend."
5.0,"A last minute trip away for some time out and choosing to stay here was the best decision.I can only agree with the reviews written by others who also enjoyed their experience at Chongfah.Location was ideal, size of the resort just right, the bungalow had everything one would need and all the meals I had at the restaurant were very tasty and good value. All staff were exceptional - friendly, caring and very genuine about making sure my stay was special."
5.0,"It’s been one day since our five night Chongfah holiday ended. We are now in a big city hotel while visiting friends. Am I missing waking to the sound of waves breaking outside my seaside bungalow? Yes. Am I missing the wonderful amenities included with that bungalow? Yes. Am I missing the most amazing breakfast choices I may have ever been offered? Yes. Am I missing excellent sunset meals at that same restaurant? Yes. You can read the many reviews about all of these and all of them a part of my five-star rating. So what do I miss the most? I miss the staff and the guests. I miss Zel (more about her later) greeting me in the morning as I step out of the bungalow to enjoy the morning. I miss Yado’s smile and warm greeting as he seats me for the included breakfast. Each day I would enjoy a coffee latte while waiting for my to join me. I also miss a lovely family of five visiting from Brussels and dining with us twice. When grandparents are separated from grandchildren, they enjoy the company of children. By the way, all of the staff at this small property were fantastic. I do not have one complaint. When my wife and I began making plans to celebrate our 43rd wedding anniversary I began considering Phuket. My son suggested Khao Lak. It was a great suggestion. I began reading Trip Advisor and some other reviews. I watched some YouTube videos. I quickly decided Khao Lak was the place. After making our reservation, I messaged Chongfah on Facebook. For over two months we conversed about our holiday. On arrival I learned that I had been messaging with the very personal Zel. She was readily available to make sure this experience was perfect...and it was perfect. The location was ideal for us. For the time we chose to not relax at Chongfah we were a 5-10 minute safe walk (day or night) to a massage (we went to Bussada Massage four times), shopping, many good restaurants, and the enjoyable Bang Niang Market. You should not be surprised to read that we plan to return...possibly next year."
5.0,3years later we came back this hotel. It was good as usual. friendly staff.  warm welcome. Quality Breakfast. Thank you Chongfah Team. always make our stay relaxed. definitely will be back again. From Bernard & Eva
5.0,We visited in August 2018 and the hotel and facilities were fantastic! Although it rained alot while we were there unfortunately it still was such an amazing stay! The staff go out of their way to make your stay! The morning breakfast we have included in our stay and is also very good and you can order off the menu what you would like! Perfect! We also did the cooking class there and it was very fun! Definitely would recommend and would be back.
5.0,Me and my family (my youngest son is 16) are staying at this small but beautiful resort for five nights. The staff is extremly friendly and service oriented and the breakfast is great. Large and clean rooms with nice bathrooms. The pool area is very relaxed and is located right by the Andaman Sea. The hotel has an adult touch to it and I would not recommend it for families with small kids. The hotel is probably the comfiest we have ever stayed at!
5.0,"We spent a lovely few days in this amazing resort. The rooms were excellent, the pool has an amazing view. The service was some of the best I have ever experienced. If you are planning a trip to enjoy peace and quiet in lovely surroundings give this place a look you will not regret it!"
5.0,"great small/boutique resort.location is nice but the staff really makes the difference! they're all helpful and always kind, smiling and ready to make sure you have everything needed.Food is very good, the highlight being the breakfast: great quality and variety!Special thank you to Zel for incredible hospitality."
5.0,Superb Boutique Hotel. Courteous staff and excellent accomodation and food. I had a Ocean Facing Room on the first floor of the Main Block and found it perfect. Very quiet location bang in front of the Ocean. Heaven on Earth
5.0,An amazing resort with super friendly staff who are always willing to help. Good breakfast spread and lovely pool. Easy access to a lot of restaurants and massage places.Love that it is also doing its bit for the environment.
5.0,"We stayed here for a week over Easter - us being myself, my Thai wife, our baby daughter, and my sister and nephew who joined us from Germany. From the moment we arrived, we were wowed by the friendliness and attention to detail of the team. Zel and the other staff greeted us warmly, and couldn't get enough of holding our baby girl to give us a few moments of respite after a long drive.Both our rooms had been lovingly prepared with customised welcome messages made from blossoms and flower stems. We also found a beautiful wooden baby cot, as well as a little baby bath tub in the shower. Zel left us to settle in, and told us to ask should we require anything else whatsoever.The fantastic service is what made this stay so special, and differentiated it from the many other hotel experiences we've had, both in Thailand and elsewhere. For starters, we were always greeted on a first name basis by all staff. Makes a huge difference knowing that we were more than just a room number.A couple of other examples of the great service:  when we noticed some dirt in the kids pool one morning. Upon information staff, the hotel engineer arrived within 10 minutes with a suction pump and gave it a thorough clean. On the third morning, Zel approached us at breakfast to ask if everything was ok. We mentioned that the kids had gotten a couple of mosquito bites overnight. We were immediately offered a mosquito net, and every day thereafter, staff lit two mosquito repellent incense pots outside both of our rooms, twice daily. No more bites since!The breakfast menu also deserves a special mention - it offered a range of warm Western and Thai dishes, 6 types of bread with various cheeses, cold meats and jams, muesli, yoghurt, and even sushi, as well as 10 or so fresh fruit juices and a selection of fresh exotic fruits, all of which changed daily to avoid too much repetition. Best of all are the omelette and waffle/pancake stations, which are made freshly to guest's specifications, and brought to their tables.As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel beach is quite small and only accessible to kids during low tide. However, there are a couple of nice beaches within easy walking distance (10 minute casual stroll), and the hotel pool is great. All this directly on the seashore, with amazing views day and night, yet only a 10 minute walk or short tuk til ride to local convenience stores, bars, restaurants, massage parlours and more.We were definitely very happy with our stay here, and will gladly come back to Chongfah when we are in Khao Lak again."
5.0,"Our decision to stay at Chong Fah was largely swayed by the very positive reviews on Trip Advisor – which we would agree with!After staying at a larger resort in Krabi for 8 nights, Chong Fah felt a bit small when we arrived – but this feeling disappeared very quickly!This is one of the most tranquil and relaxing places we have ever stayed and we can understand why people come back year after year.We had a seafront villa for 6 nights which was only a few meters back from the sea wall and crashing waves.We had a couple of sun loungers just in front – underneath a couple of palm trees. The perfect spot to read and catch some sun.The main restaurant/bar is a short walk away and again just a few meters back from the sea.The buffet breakfast was excellent – with lovely fresh fruit and pretty much anything else you could think of. Very good coffee too.The pool was lovely too – with stunning sea views and a great place to enjoy a sundowner!This boutique hotel has a special atmosphere created by the amazing setting combined with the excellent staff!Genuinely warm and hospitable – and we would like to say a huge thank you to Yada, Roger, Zel, Toom and the rest of the team for making our stay so special! Nothing was too much trouble.We celebrated my 50th birthday at Chong Fah and the staff helped to make it a very special day indeed.While we were at breakfast, house-keeping decorated our bed “Happy Birthday” style and it looked amazing!In the evening, the team set a special table on the terrace and Jimmy (the Chef) prepared a special crab curry (my favourite) which was absolutely superb.The sea is powerful here and the sea wall is required to keep the crashing waves at bay. Sometimes (at high tide) the waves would splash over the sea wall!We loved the noise of the sea but others may not.If you want the beach, you need to head north or south. At very low tide you can get to the beaches easily from the hotel. Most other times you need to walk by road – which was fine for us.The Northern beach (5 mins walk away) is lovely to walk on. White sand and goes on for miles. A real paradise feel.The Southern beach (10 mins walk away – because you have to zig-zag) is very nice too but more bars/hotels visible from the beach.Overall the resort location suited us well. Close to the sea and very tranquil.The various beach resorts we saw were set back a fair way from the sea. They looked nice but on balance we preferred our location.Also, you were a short walk or Tuk Tuk ride away from loads of restaurants, bars and massage parlours.Last but not least, our room was lovely. A very comfy bed, spacious bathroom and great aircon.We will definitely be returning to Chong Fah! It is a very special and relaxing place."
5.0,"We stayed here for two weeks. It was wonderful. We stayed in the garden bungalows. Room was spacious and bed large. Had a outside shower and bath too - there is an inside shower too.Pool was fab - infinity pool overlooking the ocean with jacuzzi jets on the other side of the pool. Cocktail hour was spent in the pool drinking. Such fun.Breakfasts were excellent - wide choice from coooing station for any type of eggs, to a selection of different breads, cheese, cold meat. The juices are amazing : passion fruit, guava, watermelon, lychee, papaya and more. The fruit selection is great too - I will miss this each morning that is for sure! Watermelon, papaya, pineapple, melon, mango - yum!Staff were amazing. They go out their way to make you feel special. Call outs are for Zel, Amy, Roger and Yada - but in fairness all staff are excellent.Day trips to Surin Islands (3 snorkelling stops) was outstanding. Excellent visibility and large range of fish seen. Lovely beach stop for lunch.Day trip to the Kam Islands. Beautiful unspoilt beaches and some beaches we were the only ones on it! Lunch was delicious - one of my best meals here in fact. Snorkelling was sadly not possible that day due to poor visibility. However, the upside was that we saw a school of dolphins - not once but twice was we were sailing between the islands! The lunch stop has a view point you can climb too - but be careful as it is slippery but you have lots of tree branches to steady yourself.Tsunami museum - confronting but very educating. Two rooms to see - upstairs is the video which is very moving.Moo Moo cabaret was such fun. It is a lady boy show. Energetic, fun and outrageous - can highly recommend! Speak to Yada who will book you a table. We got great seats. It is free and you buy drinks and tip the performers afterwards.We took a taxi to White Sand Beach. Big restaurant with many sun loungers you can hire (150 bhat for two) and the taxi was (350 bhat each way). Lovely beach and calm sea to swim in. You can take long beach walks here on either side of the sunloungers.Turtle sanctuary - on a naval base and where you can see the police boat which washed up onto the land. The turtles are amazing and there is a deserted beach there too. Well worth a look. The hotel offers free rides there every Tues.Restaurants we can recommend are:Green pepper (Thai)Thai corner (Thai)Siam (Thai)Amici (Italian- the fungi pizza infused with truffle oil was delicious)Pinocchio (Italian - tuna salad was huge and delicious)Rusty Pelican (Mexican)Chongfah resort hotel (Thai - liked various dishes here and they had a lovely nasi goreng).Thank you Chongfah resort for an amazing holiday. You are the best!!"
5.0,"Love this hotel, absolutely gorgeous place to stay. We spent a week in a Seaview Bungalow, and it is unbelievably well designed. So comfortable. My main objective was to remember how to sit still and do absolutely nothing, happy to say I did manage to do this. I also spent a lot of time in the fantastic pool. Location is good as well. And not to mention the outstanding staff. And the great happy hour where you actually get to meet others staying at the hotel and of course enjoy the excellent sea view. The only let down is the restaurant. Such a pity as such a prime spot. Would be good to see the restaurant serve top notch Thai tucker as this is sadly lacking in nearby restaurants and many of the guests at the hotel were a bit older and did not want to eat pizza or Mexican, but real, proper Thai food which used to be all you could find in Thailand. If the restaurant improved and served good Thai, I'd be happy to return for another sit still and enjoy the serenity holiday!"
5.0,"I don’t know even where to start with describing how wonderful this hotel is. All the staff are fabulous, they make you feel so special and go out of their way to help you with everything, you never have to wait for anything and are properly pampered. The restaurant Seaborn is fabulous, we ate there 4 nights out of 6 and the two nights we didn’t we wished we had! The steak night was particularly good I had a fabulous tuna steak and my husband had tenderloin both cooked to perfection! We stayed in both a sea view bungalow and a garden bungalow. Both were great, but I would highly recommend the sea view bungalows for the view. I said to my husband on our second day “I feel sorry for anyone who never gets to stay here” I was so upset to have to check out. Book it you will not be sorry."
5.0,"Our second time in Khao Lak, first at Chongfah and it won't be our last!I had read the reviews on TA and wondered how there could be so many amazing reviews. Staff:They are so high in customer service and really couldn't do enough for us.Picked up by Roger head of food and beverages from our original accommodation. Friendly,  professional and informative. Receptionists - Zel was outstanding,  even giving us water bottles to take out on walks without being asked. Amy,  continuously checking how we were. All staff friendly,  waving and smiling 😁View:Wonderful sunsets over the sea. Infiniti pool beautiful, however, on our first day my husband slipped on the very shiny, slippery steps and is still, 3.5 weeks later sporting a huge bruise and thinks he may have chipped a bone in his arm. Some grit or slip strips wouldn't go amiss. The beach walk is only very limited due to tides,  these are posted each morning in the restaurant. It would be nice to have a mutual agreement with the Mukdara for guests to walk through. We had to swim to Chongfah steps once when the tide came in!Great mini mart across the road for all your needs. Food:The breakfast choices were outstanding! As I suffer from food intolerances and also don't eat meat I thought I would struggle. Absolutely not! I didn't even need to let them know as there were so many options; 8 fruit juices, cereals, breads,  condiments,  salads,  cheese,  noodles etc.,  egg station, pancake station plus an additional menu! Dinner menu we weren't as impressed with (Asian buffet), would suggest that they made everything to order to ensure that dishes were hot (especially tempura and kebabs). Pad Thai was lovely as was the fish soup. Lunch was the usual offerings done to a good standard but expensive, as all resorts tend to be. Happy hour cocktails 2 for 1 good with view to die for. Housekeeping,  really good with excellent turn down service. Suggest that glass or reusable sustainable 'Chongfah' bottles replace the plastic ones and get a large water filtered one to fill up from in reception/ restaurant etc. Good branding choice and means your advertising works for you when guests return overseas. Comfortable bed and good pillow menu (recommend the gel cool one)Wifi good if required. Loved the eco aware status. A trip to the turtle sanctuary was enjoyable (baby seats available on the bus).Great location in high season, we'd be interested to know which restaurants and shops are open during green season as this is when we have previously travelled to Khao Lak.All in all,  please keep doing what you are doing. Our grown up children are thinking of visiting with their partners. 5 star Chongfah! See you again x"
5.0,Stayed for 7 nights in this great hotel which has a beautiful  infinity pool overlooking the sea. From the pool or the adjacent bar we saw some amazing sunsets whilst enjoying happy hour cocktails. Breakfast was varied and we had the most beautiful eggs cooked to order each day. The spring rolls we had for lunch were the best we have ever had. We had dinner in the restaurant on two evenings including the Chinese New Year gala dinner. The food was of the highest standard. Wine in the hotel was expensive but that is true in most Thailand restaurants.One slight negative was lack of a beach at high tide but it still was easy to swim in the sea. Great place and very enjoyable stay.
5.0,"From the friendliness of the staff to the wonderful rooms and fantastic breakfast I cannot fault this hotel. We were a group of four adults and stayed 5 nights. This is a quiet resort  with no loud music, just the sound of the sea and birds. The infinity pool was a delight, plenty big enough to swim lengths or simply enjoy the vista.The variety and freshness of the breakfast is lovely, there's a pancake or waffle station and an egg station cooked fresh. Loads of fruits, yoghurts, great bread selection, jams, cold meats, cheeses, salads, hot choices both Asian and English. Plentiful supply of bathroom and beach thick very large towels. There's a never ending supply of hot water in super wet rooms which back onto the quiet road therefore muffling any road traffic in rooms. We ate in hotel some nights but did find the local restaurants and bars much cheaper and all within few minutes walking distance. Free bikes available at hotel in good condition, cycling much cooler way to get around than walking. The reception staff helped us book a boat captain to take us snorkling to a local reef which was great and a much cheaper than booking through tour company, we paid 1000bt each for a trip from 9 am to 2pm including lunch.Thoroughly recommend staying here, only small but great personal service and location."
5.0,From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. The staff remember your name and room numberNothing is too much trouble. Rooms are cleaned properly with nightly turndown service with a sweet treat. Often there is a towel left in the shape of something. The bed was adorned with petals on arrival saying welcome. You are checked in by Zell the chief host and she comes to chat every day asking if she can do anything for us. There is as much bottled water as you can drink and plenty of towels for the room and beachWe were given a complimentary set dinner on the second night and the Asian Buffet was spectacular both visually and taste wise. Absolutely delicious with fresh delicacies from Japan Vietnam China and Thailand. The Tom Yum soup was the best I have ever tasted  I cannot recommend this place enough
5.0,"I've been to Khao Lak several times and have always stayed at bigger resorts (Le Meridian when it was there and then the Ramada- which is actually Chongfah's sister resort I found out when there). The friend I was travelling with found chongfah online and I'm so glad stayed there. The resort is small- only 30 rooms not that it even seems that big and it was perfect for my friend and I. Although on the water, it's not a far stroll from restaurants and shops etc so you are not at all isolated. The pool is lovely and I was very happy lying by it enjoying delicious Pina Colada's. (It's surprising how many places can't make a decent pina colada- and I do judge a resort by it- chongfah passes with an A+++). If you want a big sandy beach- this isn't your place. There is a small beach accessible by stairs but the majority of the resort (while waterfront) doesn't have a beach along the front. The breakfasts are lovely and in true Thai style presented beautifully (the uniformity of the cut papaya is amazing- ok you're not going to chose a resort on how they cut their fruit- but it highlights the detail they go to). The air-con in the rooms is fantastic too- quiet and keeps the room very cool (which is how I prefer to sleep). I stayed there with a friend, but this would be a lovely resort for a romantic getaway too."
5.0,One of the best hotels that I have ever stopped in.  The beachfront location is superb and the staff cannot do enough for you.  The rooms are well equipped and a great size.The bar and more importantly - Happy Hour are just great!Will return
5.0,"We stayed at Chongfah in August 2018 for two weeks. First time visitors to Chongfah, many times to Khao Lak area. Simply loved our stay!!! Super Thai friendly service, beautiful staff, excellent ocean front location.The Hotel; Located on the ocean a short walk from the main road of shops and restaurants. Only 30 rooms set in three rows of rooms. We were ocean front and enjoyed every minute relaxing to the sound of waves crashing into the seawall. No direct beach access from the front of the room as there is a seawall - but not a problem for us - green season Andaman Sea is quite rough for swimming. We just enjoy the salt spray and sound of the surf. The Hotel is small and very personal service. The staff greeted us by name every day, the front desk and/or the food & beverage manager spoke with us every morning at breakfast to see if they could do anything to enhance our stay, and teach us a few Thai words! We were not expecting the high level of service at such a small property, and felt comfortable and well taken care of during our entire stay. A pleasant surprise of excellent service. We enjoyed the excursion to the turtle sanctuary and the swimming pool. Decent wifi in the main areas of the resort - in the room the speed was slower depending on time of day (other guests). The Room: As noted we stayed in the ocean front villa room. Absolute ocean front with crashing waves and gorgeous sunsets. The room was very clean and serviced twice daily by the friendly housekeeping staff.  Large room with plenty of storage closet, separate bathing area, and outdoor spa tub and shower. Bluetooth speaker, LCD TV, and refrigerator in the room. We don't do 'minibar' and the staff kindly removed the items to free up space for our waters and beverages. Cold aircon - once it got going, (as with many lodgings in the high electric cost areas the aircon only runs when you place the room key to activate). Several bottles of purified drinking water were provided daily and refilled at request. We loved the different turn down service 'snacks' of Thai treats in the evening. Linens and towels were of very good quality and the pillow menu a nice touch. Kudos to the staff who setup our sun loungers with towels every morning and lit the mossie stick on the patio. The Food: We were very pleased with the rate included breakfast. Excellent choices from the menu a la carte and a nice buffet spread and served in the restaurant or on the patio overlooking the ocean. Expresso beverages and juices included. We rarely dined in the restaurant for dinners - there are many dining options in Khao Lak and we wanted to try them. Occasionally we would order a light meal at Chongfah before happy hour. Excellent service, manager, and staff, great ocean side location.All things considered we had a very enjoyable stay at Chongfah and recommend a visit. Excellent staff and service level was very personalized and attentive, thank you Pancake and Roger and the rest of the staff for a relaxing holiday."
4.0,The staff at this hotel are really among the most helpful and charming ever. They really want you to have a good time! The room was very comfortable and we slept like logs. The sunsets were wonderful and with cooling sea breezes it was just great. The only drawback is that the hotel sits on a concrete bulwark to hold back the sea and you can only get down to the beach by either scrambling down rickety steps or going out to the road at the front and walking a couple of hundred yards.
4.0,We had 5 days here to relax after some hectic touring and it pretty much ticked all the boxes.There is a small beach to the side but really the dedicated vegging out takes place on the sun loungers around the splendid infinity pool and those looking out to sea.There was always plenty of loungers.The food quality was good  ( we had lunch here most days) especially the breakfast which was first rate and with for example a different range of fruit most mornings.A minor whinge is the rather unpleasant butter ( yes I know it’s a big ask to get better but you have high standards ! ) which spoils the good brown bread on offer.Lovely staff all all round.The bungalows are fine and with fans and aircon.Good WiFi.
5.0,"This is a beautiful little hotel in an excellent location. We had a garden bungalow, complete with outdoor private Jacuzzi. The rooms are very comfortable with good AC and as much bottled water as you can drink (possibly more). The breakfasts are again excellent and the staff are superb. I always think breakfast overlooking the sea is a lovely way to start the day. We took advantage of the Turtle Sanctury trip on our final day as we had a late flight and it was a good way to spend the morning...especially when the only charge was entrance! I think that the fact that we were provided with a late check out...without asking and without charge, says a great deal for this hotel!"
5.0,"Truly the best hotel I've ever stayed in; the kindness of the staff and the service they provide, the big beautiful room, the beach view, the extensive breakfast, the amazing food (diner), and I could go on. Nothing is too much to ask, it's very clean and beautiful. I would go back in an instant and would recommend anyone to going here"
5.0,Stayed with a baby 3 weeks in september. Low season which means empty resort and some maintenance work. We had a great stay. Very well maintained resort and a relaxing pool area. Important as we could not swim in the ocean due to high waves. The staff is wonderful. You really feel taken care of. Attention to details and great with kids.
5.0,"Honestly a fine hotel. We were relocated here due to the Ramada renovation. Stayed in a Garden Bungalow and what a spacious room. Outside Jacuzzi and Shower and internal separate bathroom.A big shout out to all the staff here from the receptionists, maids to the restaurant staff. Always friendly and willing to assist. A special mention to Khun Pancake who was always checking n things and giving us the smile that Thailand is known for.Food is great with an a'la carte breakfast and buffet. Choose freshly prepared dishes off the menu to compliment your buffet selection. Coffee is fresh and some of the best i have had in Thailand.Would I go back.....without a doubt. good job Team Chong Fah."
5.0,"This is our final night of a six night stay and  this resort has exceeded our high expectations. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted like royalty with flower leis, welcome drink, snacks and even sandwiches as we arrived late evening; all staff, from reception to housekeeping to restaurant, are welcoming and friendly, greeting you by name and anticipating your every need; our sea view bungalow was spacious and comfortable with a great espresso pod machine for early morning coffee; the restaurant food was excellent and so well priced, we didn’t bother going out to eat- great 2 for 1 cocktails too; the infinity pool was clean and a perfect temperature for daily swims; there were little treats every afternoon at bed turndown time. What an absolute pleasure it has been to holiday here at this divine piece of paradise where their only wish is for you to be happy!"
5.0,"I stayed overnight in Chongfah Beach Resort with a group of friends just 1 night when joining our friend's wedding in Khaolak. This was the first time I visited this resort. Due to the green season, the price is so special offer. During my stay everything in the hotel were exceeding my expectation. Upon check-in,  nice and friendly receptionists welcomed me with smiles and served a welcome drink with a small cup of coconut jelly. Next I got a Seaview Bungalow with full set up of  amenities, WOW! Actually I didn't expect anything much, but they made me feel special then.The Seaview Bungalow equipped with all necessary things you need like having beach holiday at home: comfortable beds, a warm sofa with cushions, an espresso machine, a beach bag, an umbrella if raining, a seating area at the front and just two steps to the sunlougers overlooking the beach. Just one night stay, I had a super relax weekend here. I went to swim twice with friends in resort's pool; enjoyed taking a bath in the private jacuzzi with the lemongrass ELLE Spa set; slept very well after the wedding party in quiet atmosphere, and had late breakfast with a number of Thai and Western food selections!Just two things I missed as I don't have enough time to try: the Happy Hour in Sunset evening and the massage. Only one and a half hour driving from where I live in Phuket, I am pretty sure I will stay longer there next time and I will try all."
5.0,"My boyfriend and myself woke up one morning and decided to drive over to Khao Lak to relax for a day and we decided on Chong Fah as it was the #1 hotel in the ranking and it was worth every single cent!From the moment we stepped in to the day we checked out, the staffs made us feel so welcomed and warm. We were greeted by Pancake (she is definitely the hotel's asset!) and she is amazing. She is attentive and always so friendly. We got the sea facing villa (please book this if you can!) and the room has everything we need. It even comes with Jacuzzi and an outdoor shower (can't believe I forgot to take pictures!). Bed and pillow were comfortable and we slept with the door opened, to the sound of the waves. It was low season but we got 2 days of sun. Yes, we were very lucky. Pool was fantastic but I didn't see any baby/kids pool around. Our package was half-board. Dinner was nothing worth shouting for but it was nice enough for us -  authentic local thai food. Breakfast is a la carte and prepared by chef.One night was too short for this beautiful resort and beach. We are definitely coming back and Chong Fah will be our only choice."
5.0,"This place is AMAZING. We just visited for 6 nights in August so it was out of season but still a full compliment of staff who are the most professional people I have ever met... and the nicest. They could do no better at all. The check in was fantastic where two lovely ladies, one called Pancake attended to our every need and showed us our quite frankly out of this world room. We had a seafront bungalow which had the most fantastic views and brilliant facilities. The pillow menu was also a great touch. The bed was wonderful and the jacuzzi fab! We ordered room service on the first night after a long flight and it came promptly and with a smile, and was delicious. There was a good selection at breakfast including a hot option with Roger overseeing that everything was ok. Lovely man. Anything we asked for was met with a smile and was sorted for us. Service is first class. The resort is small and so friendly with waves and cheery hellos from everyone as we went by. The pool is delightful with an amazing sea view. I needed to use a gym on the holiday and popped into a hotel nearby to ask if I could use their’s to be met with utter rudeness, so not all hotels are the same in this area. Chongfah is by far the best place we have ever stayed by a mile...oh and the airport pick up is also great, to be met with a smile and an air conditioned car with leather massaging seats was a real treat. If you are going to Khao Lak, other hotels may be larger but I don’t see how any could be as good as this. Book this hotel...it’s AMAZING. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
5.0,"Beautiful view, amazing  team, good restaurant and breakfast , lovely swimming  pool. We came for 4 nights and stay for a week.   Very very clean room . The best hotel  we stayed in ThailandThe team was so sensitive to all our needs"
5.0,"Stayed in seaview bungalow with uninterrupted views of the ocean. Very clean with quality furniture and amenities throughout. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, offering a personalised service. An example is the choice of different types of pillows to suit individual needs. There are many choices for Breakfast, food quality was good. Resort offered activities like a free trip via minibus to the Turtle Conservation Center and the front desk offered recommendations for tourist sites in the greater khoa Lak area. Highly recommended."
5.0,"We loved this place - excellent customer service, great location (walking distance to everything), and loved our ocean front room. The staff went over and above to make sure we had a good stay, and we loved the table service at breakfast where they remembered our usual coffee orders each morning. Very comfortable room, and lovely pool area that was never too busy. Would recommend to anyone travelling to Khao Lak."
5.0,we recently stayed at chongfah after literally walking in off the main street and inquiring about accom.they led us to a comfortable room with king size bed balcony with sun lounges table and nook supplied a single bed for daughter clean large bathrooms flat screen bar fridge and the most attentive staff you could ask for.nothing was to much trouble.location only a ten minute walk to main markets.bars restaurts massage suits conv stores 1 minute very quite this time of year hot humid rain mabye but usually short bursts.ammanities very boutique not many rooms very few people so excellant one on one service biggest thanks Pancake (no thats her name!) Roger and i think lea froom lobby as wellas everyone else at chongfah good work great job .will see you next time
5.0,"The beach-front bungalows are nice and new, spacious with all the amenities. The staff is exceptional and caring, always smiling and willing to help. Only whish you could hear the waves more instead of the noisy air con. The beach itself is too narrow to be usable, but the bungalows have a private terrace with a seating area and your own lounge chairs, and the infinity pool is magic.There’s a small convenience store right in front and a cluster of tourist restaurants and shops within walking distance on the right handside. There offer free bicycles for the guests if you need to go around, e.g to the 7-Eleven which is 1km away at the intersection with the main road. I would not recommend the restaurant of the hotel. Thai cuisine is supposed to be all about the right mix of sauces, fresh herbs and spices, but the chef only uses chili. Better walk 5 minutes and eat outside for something more flavorful, even though unfortunately the food scene in Khao lak in general is quite poor."
5.0,"Early last month my husband and i had our 5th visit to this wonderful resort. As per our other stays we were made so welcome by the fantastic staff. Our comfy king size bed was decorated with a beautiful towel and flower arrangement. Breakfast has a good assortment to choose from and sitting looking out at the Andaman sea is so relaxing even though it is a bit rough that time of year. We ate in at their own restaurant, Seaborn for a lot of meals. There is a good selection of dishes and happy hour for cocktails is a bonus. There are plenty of other eating places close by and the Bang Niang Market is on 4 times a week with lots of food to choose from. There are a few little supermarkets down the road to buy snacks and any essentials. You have use of the resorts bikes which is a fun way of getting around and of course there are taxis just out the front. Lots of places to hire motor bikes and get laundry done close to the resort. Also plenty of massage places close by. The infinity pool is beautiful and the grounds are kept so neat (a credit to the groundsman). Make sure you go on the complimentary bus trip to the Sea Turtle Conservation Centre at the Naval Base.  We keep going back to Chong Fah for the peaceful atmosphere and the wonderful staff, some of them having been there since our first stay in 2011. We will be returning again."
3.0,"We booked a sea front villa and were very happy we had.   The villas behind the front row appeared a little crowded together.    The price included breakfast and overall it was a good price for what we received.We could walk back to the main road and the market and many little shops and the resort restaurant was quite lovely.   The staff looked after the grounds and pool really well including laying powder around every individual building to prevent ants entering.The room was a good size and very comfortable.  What we didnt like were:used toilet paper had to be placed in a bin rather than being flushed; there was a big wall and rocks at the beach front and there really was no beach as we would have liked; andas we have found with so many Thai resorts, European guests love smoking but fortunately the smokers at this resort were very lovely and tried hard not to smoke near other guests.  But smoke does seem to find us!"
5.0,We chanced upon this as it was the first place we looked at...just winging it.  Has a wonderful feel and and a very relaxing environment.  Our bungalow was superb and the service excellent. Not many guests as it was the low season which gave another dimension to the character of this place.  The food was excellent in the restaurant and breakfast enjoyable and filling.  We will be back for sure on our next wind down weekend.
5.0,"Faultless. Great location on the water's edge. Lovely staff. Beautiful pool and grounds. Large rooms. Excellent housekeeping with extra touches like free nibbles. Breakfast is great. Happy hour 5 to 6.30pm - cocktails 110 baht. Restaurant food is excellent and pricing reasonable for the quality and location. Free hire of good quality bikes. 2 to 5 minute walk to cafes, restaurants and shops. Only 30 rooms (half are villas) so intimate atmosphere. I could go on... Only downside is that if you want a beach in front of the hotel (instead of rocks) you need to go to somewhere like La Vela. Personally I would pick here every time."
5.0,"Any season rain or shine, ChongFah Resort in Khao lak is like heaven.This is our second stay at this stunning resort.Our first was 3 years ago and we stayed in the Seafront Bungalow in October, which again is out of season.  Sure, some days are windy and rainy but never cold.The Seafront Bungalow is simply fabulous.This time we did not have the budget for it so we stayed in the Seaview Deluxe room and although not as private the view from our bed was stunning across the horizon pool out to the Adaman Sea.Honestly, there is simply nothing to complain about this resort.The staff are soo nice.  Pancake (yes that is her name - sweet my name and nature) on reception is always making sure you are loving your holiday.The room is divine and always smells so clean and like lemongrass...mmmm.The property grounds are lush and spotless.  The breakfast is so yummy in any season.If you want blue skies everyday and everything open, like island trips, fishing, snorkelling, many many trips, well you need to save a bit more and book the high season.  But aware that it brings with it loads of tourists from Germany, Sweden and Australia.We love the low season.  We are here in early June, so we had, rainy days, windy days, a few days of sunshine and blue skies.  But everyday is either warm or very humid.  In early October a year and half ago we experienced some of the worst monsoon rains.  All day and night heavy heavy rain.  It was a little challenging to love it.This is our seventh trip to Thailand and we have travelled from Chang Mai to Bangkok over these years and currently find ChongFah in Khao  lak our favourite destination to relax.  Chongfah resort makes it's own sunshine.If you just seek pure luxury, Thai essence at it's best in the low season this is where you come.  If you are from a country of constant sunshine and all you need is to escape your stressful world, never spend another $2 coin, find a large drink bottle and put them in everyday and before you know it you will be on your way on your $2 holiday!I can not speak high enough about this resort.  I don't need to add photos.  Just look at the the hundreds you can find on the net."
5.0,My wife and I stayed for five nights. We met and spent time with our Daughter and her partner who arrived at the same time. The resort is well situated and the staff are lovely. Can recommend the bamboo rafting experience and the cooking class which we all did. Local markets are close and the area has many and various places to eat out catering for a wide range of visitors. The resort is very clean and rooms are comfortable and well set up. This is the off season and the weather although reasonably wet was warm and the pool was a great way to cool off. Would definitely come back.
5.0,"This was our second visit to Chongfah (we went the same time last year) and I do have to say, it was superb. It is not a huge 5 star resort. It is a small and intimate hotel, within easy walking distance of a number of bars and restaurants.  Your every wish is catered for and the staff are wonderful; nothing is too much trouble. Mrs Pancake, checks on a regular basis (usually at breakfast time) to make sure that everything is being done to your liking and that there are no problems or issues. For us, the whole visit was magical."
5.0,"Currently sitting on my lounger, in front of our room with the Andaman sea 10metres away, with the only sounds being the waves breaking gently. This is the final morning of our (second) two week stay. The hotel couldn’t have been more relaxing, it’s always been so peaceful. The staff are all great from the boys and girls who look after the rooms, those behind the scenes and those in the restaraunt, and especially ‘Pancake’ who ensures that you have everything you need. They all  genuinely go out of their way to help, nothing is ever too much trouble, even the ‘support’ staff always have a cheery wave or word.The rooms are lovely, large well appointed and clean. Food in the Seaborn Restaraunt is great, the choice at breakfast is huge particularly for such a small hotel. In our opinion it couldn’t be better positioned, being genuinely at the waters edge. This is the start of ‘low season’, but the weather has been perfect again, hot & sunny with very little rain. Bang Niang is a reasonably quiet place, but even so there is a great choice of typical restaraunts within a 5 to 10 minute stroll in the evening."
5.0,"We had five nights in this fabulous hotel and absolutely loved it. It is a class above most places we stayed during a month in Thailand and we would return in the blink of an eye. From the moment you check-in you feel it is just different than other places and I have never met an entire staff that care so much about their customers. Every effort has been made to make your stay a home from home and they succeed to a very large extent. Getting there - tuk tuk and taxi drivers all know where this places as it is very well established and well-known through the area. Location – excellent. It is three minute walk to the strip and the nearest convenience shop is right outside. Whilst it is true what certain reviews say on here it is not on the beach, it is just feet away and it has a beach feel to it without a doubt. Rooms – we opted for a garden villa but this beauty resort is of a high standard whatever accommodation you choose. The standard rooms were a very similar in layout to the villas anyway and absolutely beautiful. The space has been used really well and feel large and very comfortable. The bed was amazing and we had five great nights sleep (they offer extra mattress toppers if needed and have a pillow menu!). There are hot drinks making facilities, wonderful rainshower, safe for your valuables, umbrellas, dressing gown – I could go on! The air-conditioning was of excellent quality and there is a fan in the room to help you keep cool as well. Lots of fresh water is provided free of charge every day and there is a minibar in the fridge. The balconies and porch areas are wonderful as well. Spacious with sunbeds on the table and chairs. Mosquito coils are provided as well and they really have thought of everything. Pool – this is much bigger than we expected as somebody described it as a plunge pool – this it is not! It is not the biggest but it is beautiful and good enough for a good swim. It looks straight out over the beach and has lots of sun beds around it with parasols so you can always get shade. The whole resort has lots of sun beds in it and there are a lot more than guests! A real plus for the resort. There's also a table tennis table! We borrowed free bikes every day and there are Thai newspapers around as well.Food – we only had breakfast there but it was fantastic. To say there are limited people that because of the number of rooms the spread is wonderful. A mix of international and Thai cuisine all of an extremely high standard  -the coffee was great and the juice the best we had during the holiday. The service is wonderful and you can take breakfast right out by the beach which is lovely. Noise – we encountered very little indeed.  The villas would be the quietest option as they are set on their own and have a little more space than the standard rooms. That said even those would be very quiet dependent only on other guests. We managed five excellent nights sleep with the only sounds being from the birds which was lovely and the occasional monsoon crashing on the roof! Wi-Fi – excellent. Free for unlimited devices and I could easily stream video and so on. Around 10 Mb per second which is great for this area. Staff – absolutely amazing. They simply cannot do enough for you and any request promptly, professionally and with a smile. I really cannot speak highly enough of this hotel."
5.0,"My husband and I returned to Chongfha in March/April of this year and were not disappointed. This boutique hotel still evokes a feeling of relaxation and tranquility. The staff here cannot do enough for you and because this is a relatively small hotel you are not just a room number, you feel a valued guest. The sea view bungalows, where have your own sun beds, are immaculately clean with air conditioning, ceiling fans, tea and coffee facilities and mini bar.Considering the size of Chongfah, the breakfast choices are excellent and should cater for every palate. Unlike some of the larger hotels where the prices are so much higher than in the town of Khao Lak, the lunch and dinner menu is reasonably priced and the food is of excellent quality. All is cooked fresh so don’t expect the speed of a fast food restaurant. We had visited Khao Lak before our first time at Chongfah, but we have been so happy here that we could not stay at any other hotel in this location. I would like to finish this review by sending our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to all the staff who welcomed us and made our stay so wonderful, particularly Pancake and Roger and his team."
5.0,"I feel as though I have just left my family upon checking out of the hotel, having been personally farewelled to the taxi by two of the staff. My overall impression of Chongfah Resort was one of relaxation and friendliness. If you want bars and partying then don't come here. If you want a gorgeous location, peace and quiet, reasonably priced and delicious food and incredibly friendly staff, then I would emphatically recommend staying here.The rooms are private, the air conditioning good, the shower has good water pressure and lots of hot water. The beds are firm but they will add layers on top of the mattress to make it softer if you wish. There is a pillow menu too! The first night of our stay it rained just as we were venturing out for dinner so we just walked directly over the road. A big mistake. We discovered that the restaurant at the hotel not only had much better food, but it was also cheaper! The restaurant overlooks the sea and is a very relaxing setting for dining. Breakfast had a variety of food and there were quite a few dishes you could order from the cooking station. Each morning incredibly friendly and genuinely caring young lady, aptly named Pancake, moved around the tables asking if everything was OK with the food, your room etc and answering any questions you may have. She could also arrange a massage, a tour, extra pillows and so on. Thank you for being so friendly, welcoming and genuinely interested in our wellbeing Pancake. It was also lovely to be greeted by a number of staff by name, adding to the personalised service we received.Although the resort doesn't have a beach as such, you can swim in the sea, relax on the deck chairs overlooking the sea or swim and relax at the gorgeous, bath temperature pool.We leave Chongfah Resort knowing that, if possible, we shall return again one day. Thanks to the amazing team who work here. You made our stay extra special."
5.0,Excellent “boutique” hotel.  Rooms on the oceanfront had fantastic views.  Location is easy to walk to nearby restaurants and stores.  Small property with lots of privacy.  Access to beach limited to side of property.
4.0,"Spacious, well laid out room with a really nice balcony and comfy bed - really liked the pillow menu and thought that was a great little addition.  The staff at this resort are extremely helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  The hotel was in a great location - right on the seafront (although there is no beach at the hotel as such) and the pool was lovely - looking right out to sea.  The only downfall was that the hotel had unfortunately double booked our room and as a result we had to move hotel mid stay.  We would have loved to stay for longer and were sad to leave but the staff went out of their way to try to apologise and make it up to us and even came to visit us at our new hotel.  If it wasn't for that I would definitely have given them a 5 out of 5 rating as it really is a nice hotel.  Perfect if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing stay, but within easy reach of plenty of shops, hotels and bar, as well as the local market which is definitely worth a visit."
5.0,"Yet another wonderful stay at the Chongfah Resort, which is the ideal place to relax and enjoy the lovely location, Thai food, culture and beach. The staff are a real credit to the hotel and we have yet to stay at a hotel that has staff, who are so helpful and dedicated to making sure that the guests enjoy their stay at the resort.I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the Resort, as everything about it is first class and it is always a great pleasure to stay there."
5.0,"A very warm welcome and nothing too much trouble.  The hotel is situated on the sea front though access to the beach is limited due to the tide.  We were however aware of this having reviewed the hotel before booking.  That said it is not that far of a walk to access the beach a little further down the road.  The rooms are of a good size with large comfortable beds and a choice of pillows/mattresses if these weren't to your liking.  Plenty of storage/hanging space, safe, tea/coffee facilities, toiletries etc.  Air con worked efficiently and bathroom of a good size with large walk in shower.  Rooms cleaned to a very good standard and clean beach towels left each day along with plenty of bottled water.  Turn down service of an evening and again further water supplied if you wished.  At all times all staff were approachable, friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  There were several repeat guests which is always a good sign.  We had also requested early check in as we were due to arrive at approx 9am having travelled overnight.  Whilst they could not guarantee this in advance, they did confirm that they would do their best - the room was ready for us on arrival which was much appreciated. There are plenty of restaurants all within a close walking distance of the hotel."
5.0,"Spaceous, well-equipped room overlooking the sea. Excellent meals with lots of variety, served with quiet calm and cheerfulness. Staff were charming and very helpful. All the hotel lacks is its own beach."
5.0,"2nd stay at this hotel, and yet again, a really relaxing time spent here.One thing before I continue, while browsing any tour operators guide to this hotel, you may be confused into thinking that this is a "" beachfront "" hotel...!!Well, it's quite simply NOT the case( pictures provided  for you to decide for yourselves.)But now look at the possitve of this small, and idyllic boutique style hotel.It's situated away from the town of khao lak, nxt to the sea, so perhaps that's where the confusion may be regarding "" beachfront."". It has approx 30 rooms on the site, comprising of 8 detached seafront small bungalow style rooms, plus about the same number of  style detached rooms sited behind them.You then have a approx 12 smaller but ample space rooms set on two floor,( similar to duplex style one on top the other), should you require disabled access, then the lower rooms will be no problem for you.. the hotel is set in a very nice a tranquil oasis type setting, with palm trees, exotic plants and ornamental flowers/ pots.The pool is a plunge type the is approx 25mtre long and 1.3mtre deep ( depth is same throughout).And it is an infinity pool.Staff here are truly wonderful people and they are there for you day and night, and they remember you if you have stayed before, that's  a lovely touch.Food is very varied and fresh each day.As we were here on Christmas eve, there was a gala evening put on by the owners and staff for guests.Food was included in your price for staying here for this night, you just paid for your drinks.Pancake is the lovely lady that oversees your stay here, and her and her staff are  credit to the owners of this hotel.If you want a relaxing holiday just sat sunbathing by the pool, or you want to experience the khao lak area of Thailand and then return to peace and quiet, read a book, sip a cocktail and watch the sun go down, you won't go wrong staying here.A week?, or just a stopover on your way to another destination, this hotel CHONGFA RESORT, will give you a very warm welcome.."
5.0,"By far the best end to end holiday experience I have had at a hotel... ever and it is consistent!Chong Fah is my favourite home away from home.... the staff is incredible ... Super friendly, always trying to help... The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable and the pool area just right.... never crowded or noisy.The most impressive is the incredible attention to detail ... everywhere... in the room, the cute towel folding, the welcome message... the extravagant Christmas dinner and deserts... I can go on and one... just loved our stay once again.Well done aching Fah team! I will be back early in 2018!"
5.0,"From the second we got here we couldn't have been made to feel more welcome, fantastic friendly helpful staff, a beautiful location & great prices make this a jewel of a hotel I would recommend to anyone who would like to experience the famous Thai hospitality."
5.0,"The staff is exceptional, they will do everything for you. The rooms are very nice and they have comfortable beds and a nice terrace. Very tasty breakfasts, with an ocean- view, the best coffee, banana bread, a large variety of juices and the best stuffed tomatoes ever. The nicest pool in the world! This place is how I imagine Paradise looks like."
5.0,"We visited Chongfah  Beach Resort to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.From the moment we arrived the service and the resort were just like the majority of reviews on TA. For the first time on a holiday I think we ate more at the hotel than we did outside, the price of the food is comparable with other restaurants and the food is great. We had a Seaview bungalow and it was worth every penny, loved the jacuzzi and the outdoor seating area. If we ventured to the pool there was always enough sunbeds for other guests.Thank you to all the staff Yada, Nan, Sod, Rong, Pancake, Mind & On ( hope we didn’t forget anyone). Enjoy the happy hour and try the Tom Yum cocktails.. looking forward to another stay next year."
4.0,"My partner and I stayed here from mid Sept to early October 2017.  Rooms very clean and serviced daily (if you wanted them too).  Pool area was nice with plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas.  Dined in the restaurant a few times and had no complaints whatsoever, plenty to select from the menu.  Breakfast was tasty with a wide range of choices.  The staff really make this place and ""pancake"" (a staff member was helpful and friendly),, scooter hire just down the road (Gerd & Noi) 200b for the day.  Minimart across the rd which sells a variety of goods.  Plenty of restaurants within a short distance and a few currency exchange booths.  Wifi speeds were great  but wasn't too worried if they weren't.  Bike hire if you need them (no cost)Now if you want great beaches then you need to stay at coconut or white sand beach as the beaches in the area weren't much chop.. The beach outside the resort inst accessible (even when the tide is out) as you would have ""negotiate"" getting over large rocks which await at the bottom of the stairs.All in all we loved staying here and enjoyed our trip even though it rained quite a bit but didn't care as we both needed some serious R&R"
5.0,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Chongfah Beach Resort.The staff is what really sets them apart.  The hotel, food, pool, etc...are all great, but what I will remember are the people.From the pandan leaf folding class to the trip to the sea turtles this hotel did more that you would expect for its guests.  During the heavy rains they even escorted us from the room under big garden fur other umbrellas!The only thing to be aware of is there is a 'very small' beach on the property itself, though it is right on the water.  You can walk down the road to a bigger beach with massage huts, bars, etc.... if that is what you are looking for.In short, stay here!"
5.0,"My husband and I stayed in a beachfront bungalow in July 2017 for 4 nights and it was pure bliss.The room is amazing with an outside jacuzzi.  We loved the daily towel folding art and the masses of towels that were on offer.  The outdoor seating was wonderful for lazy afternoons and room service will bring you drinks to you.We went to 1 happy hour at the pool bar and there was no-one there.  It would be nice if the staff let everyone know when happy hour begins and maybe encourage people to buy a drink.Be careful when getting into the pool.  I fell down the black marble steps and badly bruised my arm.  There is a handrail but the steps are very slippery and you have to be very cautious.We ate most of our meals at Seaborne Restaurant as we found the price and quality the same as any other restaurant.  Being low season the breakfast buffet is not fully on offer so you order hot food from a menu, which is perfect.  The omelettes are amazing.We love how quiet Khao Lak is during the low season so don't expect a fast paced holiday at Chongfah.  It's so peaceful."
5.0,"Never reviewed before, but after our visit to Chongfah felt we had to. From our gracious welcome to our warm farewell all the staff were kind, genuine and nothing was too much. Our beach villa was spacious, well equipped and comfortable - particularly liked the coffee machine and wi-fi sound dock. Sunset views from the loungers are stunning. Like to thank everyone at the hotel for giving me a birthday I'll never forget. If you're looking for an oasis of calm this is the place. Definitely worth a return visit."
5.0,"With only 30 rooms it can hardly qualify as 5 star (as it obviously doesn’t have all the amenities of a huge 5 star resort), but it does have heaps going for it.It’s highly personalized, nothing is too much trouble, and they genuinely seem to want to please you and cater to your needs.We had an oceanfront bungalow which had everything we needed/wanted. Including mood candles, oil burner, mosquito coils, outdoor enclosed spa bath and 2nd shower, pillow menu, and small snacks for after dinner/before bed … etc.The service was excellent, the location was super quiet (unless you count the noise of waves crashing against the sea wall at high-tide), and the breakfast menu was fairly extensive (with a few things I didn’t expect) … and their coffee was great.We did take advantage of their free bus trip to the Turtle Conservation Centre, and thought it was well worth a visit. On the night we had dinner in The Seaborne in-house restaurant, we were well catered for and very happy with our high quality meal. Note: Their Spicy Beef Salad is SPICY !"
5.0,"Thank you to all the staff at Chongfah for creating such a memorable 50th bday for my husband Mr Peter in July. We were a party of 10 adults & two children. The staff ensured we had everything we needed and even put on a special 50th bday breakfast. The room were exceptionally clean & cleaned to a high standard daily. We looked forward to seeing the towel art each day.Beds, very comfy with a choice of pillows from the pillow menu.Lots of variety for breakfast with a buffet & ordering from a menu, great coffee best I e had in Thailand all while looking out over the ocean. Happy hour each night by the pool with a good choice of cocktails.The staff are Chongfah's biggest asset.Thank you"
5.0,"Checking in was really a breeze, a warm welcome from Sukanya and the ladies was genuinely friendly and made us feel right at home.The infinity Pool is great for a dip and laps in the early morning or late afternoon.Our air conditioned room is spacious and very comfortable, clean no stale smoke smells excellent! The bathroom is a contemporary design with a nice shower. The bed is very very comfortable. The Wifi is good. The Large  T.V screen has a good reception.Breakfast is excellent with fruit, yoghurt, and musli you can order a cooked breakfast from the menue also. The coffee is the best we have ever had from a hotel. There are lots of restaurants close by, but we dined here most of the time as the food is excellent. The hotel is situated close to a nice beach with soft sand( only accessible at low tide). Khao Lak is an ok town, the local villagers are a mix of retirees and farmers it's really laid back here. Hire a motor bikefor 150 Bht a day, from bike shop around the corner.My wife and I love this place so we will be back.Hope this helps; enjoy."
5.0,"This place is so good. From the moment we checked in, the staff were very friendly and did the utmost to fulfil every request we had. They are all very friendly, we will miss chatting to Yada and Rodger at the bar. We had a Sea View Bungalow and it was fantastic. Very spacious and clean, had a large whirlpool spa and inside + outside showers, and a large bed. My only concern here was that the bed was very wide but my feet hung off the edge (I'm 6ft tall) if I wasn't up quite high. The restaurant has nice food and plenty of choices, both western and Thai, although we found the prices to be slightly better outside the resort. Drinks at the bar were quite expensive, especially cocktails (~250 baht!), which you can definitely get cheaper if you wander outside the resort. They offer bikes that you can use which is more than enough to get around considering the great location the resort is in. We hired a scooter and found it was nice, but you definitely would get away with just the bikes. Could not recommend this place more, definitely stay here if you're looking at hotels around the area."
5.0,"Can't say enough positive things the resort is a small boutique 30 somthing  rooms...Great pool with wet edge... breakfast included order off menu what ever you like and how much you want. Nice  selection off  buffet as well, coffee, cupachino better than  most coffee shop chains... would highly recommend... if you want to relax... perfect for couples...The team at chongfa could not do enough.. to make our stay more delightful...."
5.0,"This hotel is situated on the sea front although the beach is very small but there are beaches within a 5 minute walk. The swimming pool is bigger than it looks with a magnificent view out to see, you have the impression you are swimming out to see. The staff are very friendly and helpful and can't do enough to help you. The food in the restaurant is good and reasonably priced. There are bikes available for free to use. There is a market four days a week just a 5 minute walk away and many bars restaurants and shops just up the road from the hotel. We have loved our stay here and would recommend it."
5.0,We stayed for 10 days in a sea view bungalow - great room and a massive bed with pillow menu!Pool is great and bigger than it looks in the photos.The staff are excellent and very friendly Would recommendWe went on trips to James Bond Island (do the Early Bird trip to avoid crowds) and also went to Phi Phi Islands despite it being low season. Also went to Turtle Sanctuary and bathing with Elephants. More than we expected would be possible in low season
5.0,"We came here during rainy season but still enjoyed the stay.. from start to finish nothing was too much for the staff! I read some reviews and I'm baffled by the comments, I think a lot comes down to how you treat the staff, treat them with kindness and respect and that's exactly what you get back. The staff all knew our names, and being one of the younger couples staying at the resort I have to stay it was so lovely and peaceful! Breakfast was excellent lots to choose from and I especially liked all the fresh juices to choose from, fruit and yogurts! The view is beautiful and the pool was lovely and warm. The room is kitted out with everything you need, the back of the room looks like a dressing room with a good size dressing table and wardrobe. Mosquito plugs and candles in the room, umbrellas for when it rained and great sized balcony. We really like the fact that you could use the bikes free of charge too. Great location lots of restaurants and bars with a few minutes walk! Overall brilliant stay keep up the good work! My sister and her boyfriend stayed at a hotel across the road a week later and came for the marvellous pad Thai and yummy ice cream milkshakes on our recommendation!"
5.0,"We loved everything about our stay here. We had a beach front bungalow as we were on our honeymoon and it was so luxurious waking up to the looking at the waves every morning. The cocktails were great, pool was awesome and they had free bikes you could use which was fun. The beach is washed away however we much prefer swimming in pools so this wasn't an issue for us. We did their cooking class too which was great. All staff were very friendly and spoke great English. We definitely felt at home and it was a great place to relax. Thankyou so much chongfah. We will be back again one day."
2.0,"I don't understand good reviews of this place.Deluxe room: dark, noisy air conditioner with mosquitoes in the room. We had some problems in the room and after complaining  several times, because they ignore at begining,Pancake  became rude and ironic to us.No security. Anyone can enter to the hotel. As you lay down on the sunbed, you see people walking by, and staring you.Breakfast: average and no fresh juice. Some unfriendly staff."
4.0,"I had delayed in posting this review because while this resort has its merits and commendable customer service, we continue to be at a lost at its #1 ranking on this site. Our stay was in early May. Perhaps if it was subcategorized under ""good value"" and a ""boutique-y"" vibe, then a high rating is justifiable for the Chongfah Resort (CR). But #1 for ALL of Khao Lak? We respectfully disagree. Laid-back, definitely. Luxury (as described by another reviewer)? Ur, no. To quantify our assessment, some background..... We came to Khao Lak at the beginning of the slow season and started the first half staying at what would turn out to be our best beach-front, luxury splurge resort experience ever. We had planned for switching out to a smaller, boutique-y resort for the second half and chose CR based on the raving TA reviews. Suffice to say we had so thoroughly enjoyed the first resort that any other Khao Lak resorts will pail in comparison. And in hindsight, we would've liked to have remained at our first choice the entire duration. But I don't mean to digress.....At Chongfah, based on some passing observations, I am guessing that there's possibly some planned expansion forthcoming. And some rooms were in the process of refurbishment during our stay. But for now, CR is simply a compact, bare basic sea-side compound. CR is esthetically pleasing, but nothing that stands out to explain its high ranking. The pool area overlooks into the sea and there's plenty of loungers, and even a couple of pagoda-like cabanas. Because of it being the slow season, CR told us they were at 50% occupancy, but we really never saw more than two other couples at once. Seriously, if you're a mega celebrity and looking to hide from the paparazzi, this is the place!We had a generous room that abutted a roadway but faced into the dense, resort garden. We encountered some rain during our stay, which made the covered balcony patio, and it's accompanying loungers the perfect vegging and reading spot. I'll do a separate review for their restaurant, the Seaborn. But the breakfast buffet needs some commenting. Specific staff in the dinning room must be new as they where tentative and shy. They didn't know or weren't sure of even the most basic questions. This resort is somewhat tucked away, that it will take around 12-15 minutes' walk up to the main road. Along the way are plenty of shops for inexpensive massages, tailor, dinning and bars. Resort staff were friendly and accommodating."
